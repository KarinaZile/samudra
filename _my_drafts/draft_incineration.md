One of the promising technologies, not yet available at industrial scale, is [oxy-fuel combustion][57] - using recirculated flue gas as an oxidant instead of oxygen.
THe advantages of oxy-fuel combustion technology are reduced volume of flue gas that needs to be treated, increased and stabilized combustion temperature, greatly reduced amount of nitrogen oxides, and the possibility to retrofit existing incineration plants.

The world’s first experiment to capture carbon dioxide from the fumes of burning rubbish is nearing completion in Oslo.

The test at the Klemetsrud incinerator,

The Klemetsrud incinerator emits more than 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, or 0.6 percent of Norway’s man-made emissions. 


what is nice from this flue gas from Klemetsrud is the high content of the CO2, it’s about 12 percent, volume percent, of CO2

So 300,000 tonnes comes here every year and we can capture 300,000 tonnes CO2 from those 300,000 tonnes of waste. So it’s approximately one ton of CO2 per ton of waste that can be captured


Officials declined to discuss costs but said the price of emitting carbon dioxide in the European Union emissions trading market would have to be far above a current 6 euros ($6.50) per ton for the technology to be feasible at scale.


If we succeed in this, this will be negative emissions because the mix of carbon in the waste is approximately 50 to 60 percent biological and 40 to 50 percent fossil, so the biological part of it will be carbon negative, or negative emissions,

UsingCCS  in the  waste-to-energy  industry  presents  a  particular  opportunity for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS);



Bio
80 tonnes of C -> 293 tonnes of CO2  (3.66 per tonne)

Non-bio
110 tonnes of C -> 405 tonnes of CO2 (3.68 per tonne)


MSW contains materials of biogenic (plant-derived) and non-biogenic (fossil fuel) origin. When incinerated, the biogenic component produces CO2,which does not lead to increasing atmospheric CO2levels.

If a capture project captures more than the non-biogenic fraction of its CO2 emissions, it can allow a facility to become a net-negative CO2 emitter.




CO2 concentrations for WtE are in the range best suited for capture with amine-based absorption plants.


Current developments in solvent innovation, process integration and intensification could potentially lower the CO2 capture cost to USD35-50 per tonne CO2in power generation applications.

 facility processing over 400,000 tonnes of non-recyclable MSW

Following a successful 2011 pilot project to capture 90 per cent of the CO2from a small flue gas stream, a full-scale carbon capture project is now under development. 

The project will capture 400,000 tonnes of CO2every year with an amine-based absorption capture plant. 



Saga City, Japan

Saga City in Saga Prefecture, Japan,is the home of an MSW waste-to-energy plant. Since 2016, a Toshiba-designed CO2capture plant has operated at this site(Figure 8)capturing10 tonnes/day for use in the local agricultural sector. 







Although this is an early example of large-scale capture from Waste-to-Energy, the capture process is well understood and tested in other capture applications.

[The world's first WtE plant opened in New York 1898.][38]
Since then incineration has been adopted widely by many wealthy countries, especially the ones where land is scarce, for example Singapore, Denmark and Switzerland.
According to the World Bank, [80.2% of MSW was incinerated in 2015 in Japan][39].
According to OECD.Stat, [47%-57% of MSW was incinerated in 2018 in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland][39].
Project Drawdown estimated that [WtE plants generated 142 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2018, about 0.54% of global electricity demand][6].






According to Ecoprog, a consultancy, [about 2,450 WtE plants were active worldwide in 2018][41].
Of the total global capacity of 368 million tonnes of waste per year, 14 million have been added in 2018 by building 60 new plants.


Ecoprog estimates that [about 2,700 WtE plants will be active worldwide in 2028][41], bringing the global capacity of 530 million tonnes of waste per year. 



(OECD) countries are most likely to see significant growth in its market penetration moving forward, as the primary barriers to entry for waste-to-energy are high capital cost and the reliable availability of municipal solid waste with a high caloric heating value. 













### sweden

It is estimated on average that the energy efficiency of Swedish incinerators means that they have a €30/t gate fee advantage over Netherlands and Germany. https://www.tolvik.com/published-reports/view/rdf-exports-here-for-good/

Sweden incinerates 2 million tones of waste per year. Heating 810,000 homes and providing electricity to 250,000 homes. Importing SW from Norway.


Sweden, for example, uses energy-recovery from the controlled thermal treatment of waste to heat 1.25 million homes in the winter and electricity for nearly 700,000 homes. The city of Linköping houses one of 34 incineration facilities in Sweden, which are also fueled by waste imported from neighbouring countries. This revenue-generating activity greatly subsidizes the cost of implementing and maintaining these facilities, and also helps to provide the volume of waste that is required to sustain the combustion processes at the right temperatures.

It’s worth noting that the voracious nature of incineration, where it requires large and consistent volumes of waste input to maintain ideal combustion conditions, has not reduced Sweden’s use of other landfill-alternatives for treating waste. Sweden has increased its recycling volume to 1.6 million tonnes in recent years, or about 49% of its total generated waste. Incineration makes up 50%, leaving a measly 1% of waste going to landfill.

[Denmark now has 29 Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants, serving 98 municipalities in a country of 5.5 million people, with 10 more planned for construction.][https://www.martinbiopower.com/projects/case-studies/roskilde-plant-denmark/]

[Denmark depends on burning vast quantities of garbage to generate power, using highly efficient incinerators that scrub the worst of the pollutants from flue gases. Incineration accounts for about a fifth of district heating and about 5 percent of its electricity. The trouble is that Danes don't generate enough trash to power its plants. Denmark has 23 incinerators capable of burning 3.8 million tons of waste a year; it imported nearly 1 million tons in 2018, mainly from the U.K. and Germany. 'We import waste with a high content of plastic in order to use the excess capacity at the incineration plants, with increasing CO2 emission as a result," said Dan Jørgensen, Denmark's climate minister. As a result, Denmark intends to reduce its incineration capacity by 30 percent by 2030 under a June 2020 agreement to restructure the country's waste management. To cut overcapacity, it will need to close seven incinerators. The deal also includes plans to introduce a recycling system with 10 different streams of waste (glass, paper, textiles, etc.) and to slash the amount of garbage it imports. "The process of burning trash is inherently polluting — you can put state-of-the-art pollution controls on an incinerator, but that doesn’t make the facility clean," said Jens Peter Mortensen, a waste expert at the Danish Society for Nature Conservation. The issues can be clearly seen on Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic Sea. It has the country’s smallest incineration plant, which the island aims to shut in 2032.][https://www.politico.eu/article/denmark-devilish-waste-trash-energy-incineration-recycling-dilemma/]

# in poor countries


<!-- in Africa -->
[Reppie incinerator with energy recovery][1] opened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 2018; it was the first one in Africa.
It processes about 1350 tonnes of waste a day, over 80% of the city's waste.
This results in hundreds of local jobs, cleaner air in the city and significantly less methane emissions from waste. 
The plant produces electricity to power 30% of the city's homes and bricks made from bottom ash. 





There have been numerous examples where “proven” technologies in developed countries have failed in developing countries because sufficient attention was not paid to “soft” strategic aspects, namely, political, institutional, social, financial, economic and technical elements.
- the high moisture content, low combustibility, and seasonal variations of waste make it unsuitable for direct incineration. Waste quantity may also vary by collection and transportation system, governance ability, season or as a result of natural disasters.

Incineration has been challenged in some low and middle- income countries where facilities built decades ago without proper waste characterization studies and lack of air pollution control equipment resulted in insufficient and low- quality feedstock, inefficient incineration, and high levels of air pollution. 

An extreme example is the incinerator that was marketed to a Nairobi private waste collector by a Swedish company in the 1990s, with the ‘guarantee’ that it would burn garbage
and turn it into hundreds of litres of clean drinking water


In 1984, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, India, built an incinerator to process 300 tonnes per day of solid waste and produce 3MW of power, with technical assistance from Denmark, at a cost of around US$3.5 million.The plant was designed for segregated waste as input, which was not practised by the households or promoted by the municipality.The plant had to be closed down within a week of its opening as the waste had a very low heat- ing value and a high percentage of inert materials.


There are examples in several continents of donor-funded incinerators that have never oper- ated, but have sat for years as a kind of dinosaur in the landscape.


Clearly, simply importing European, American or Japanese disposal or incineration technologies to a low- or middle-income country,without considering how they will work under local conditions, can be a recipe for environmen- tal and economic disaster.


















# calorific value of waste

Generally, waste is suitable for combustion without additional fuel when itcontains <50per cent moisture, >25per centcarbon and has <60per centash yield. https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Waste-to-Energy-Perspective_October-2019-5.pdf


lower (LHV) or higher heating value (HHV) of the waste,

The energy content of the waste, the average lower calorific value (LCV) must be at least 4000-6000 KJ/kg10 throughout all seasons. 2017_Solid-Waste-Management-in-Nagpur-India.pdf

[In the early days, food waste was collected and traditionally used as livestock feed especially for swine. However, due to a boom in tourism and urbanisation, piggeries were forced to close, and owners sold their land or moved to neighbouring provinces where land was much cheaper. Because of such social changes, surplus food waste was shifted into the main waste stream and organic components sent to incinerators almost doubled from 34% in 1993 to 64% in 2004.][22]
http://gmsarnjournal.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vol5no3-8.pdf



[2015 Research showed that calorific value of MSW in Tehran, Iran is insufficient to run a financially viable incinerator.][https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Techno-economic-assessment-of-municipal-solid-waste-Tehrani-Haghi/c82cf874f2870fbac46ba6561c374d88212776be]

seasonal variations in waste content must be considered. For example, waste may contain more moisture in the rainy season. 
calorific value of waste - add a definition?
Lower Calorific Value LCV is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporisation of the water from the higher heating value. this matters, not CV!
LCV must be, on average, at least 7,000 kJ/kg and never fall below 6,000 kJ/ kg for WtE incineration to recover energy [22]


For example, incineration technology can be applied to waste with a moisture content of 75% or less and a volatile content of 20% or more, which corresponds to a LCV of 3,352 kJ/ kg or more. Furthermore, in cases where energy recovery is a part of the incineration process, these technologies are generally applicable for waste with a moisture content of 65% or less and a volatile content of 30% or more, with a LCV of 6,285 kJ/kg or more. [22]
The composition of waste in low-income countries indicates that this waste can be incinerated, but it does not fall within the scope of energy recovery from incineration.
If the amount of organic waste is about 50% to 60%, incineration becomes an option. However, it is not suitable for energy recovery, which is only possible when the ratio of plastic and paper increases and food and kitchen waste falls to approximately 50% or less.

In terms of WtE incineration, MSW can be categorised into “combustible” or “non-combustible” wastes.
Combustible waste consists of organic waste and other burnable waste such as paper, plastic, and textiles that were not separated at source as recyclable resources. Non-combustible waste includes ceramic ware (teacups, plates, flowerpots, etc.), metals, glass (bottles, flower vases, mirrors, etc.), ash, and other items. 

the ratio of organic waste (food and green) tends to be highest (56%) in low-income countries and lowest (32%) in high-income countries

Higher moisture content reduces the LCV and combustion efficiency.



There is a minimum cal. val. requirement of course. it should be > 6 MJ/ton.


If due to high moisture content the waste cannot self-sustain the required temperature during combustion, additional fuel (for example propane or waste with high calorific value) has to be added.
This often occurs when more than 50% of the waste is wet biowaste.
Separating metals, glass and biowaste prior to incineration increases the calorific value of waste.

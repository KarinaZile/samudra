[Today, around 2,450 thermal waste treatment plants are active worldwide. They have a disposal capacity of around 368 million tons of waste per year. Only in 2018, more than 60 new plants had been installed with a total treatment capacity of more than 14 million tpy. We estimate nearly 2,700 plants with a capacity of more than 530 million tpy to be operational by 2028.][https://www.ecoprog.com/fileadmin/user_upload/extract_market_report_WtE_2019-2020_ecoprog.pdf]

According to World Bank 2015 data 80.2% of MSW is incinerated in Japan. https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/what-waste-global-database

in 2018, 47%-57% in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland according to OECD.Stat https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MUNW


[2018 Current adoption was estimated at 0.54 percent of generation (i.e. 142 terawatt-hours).][6]



Waste-to-energy has seen wide adoption in Europe, the USA, and Japan, and adoption is growing rapidly in China. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are most likely to see significant growth in its market penetration moving forward, as the primary barriers to entry for waste-to-energy are high capital cost (in part due to high-cost pollution control technologies, which are essential in mitigating potential adverse public health impacts) and the reliable availability of municipal solid waste with a high caloric heating value. 


While controlled thermal treatment of waste has been deployed in many countries around the world, Western Europe and Japan have adopted the technology as a substantial component of their waste management portfolio, demonstrating the potential effectiveness given the right political environment.

Rotary cement kilns and lightweight aggregate kilns, for example, have been used since 1972, with some early examples in Canada. These kilns became widespread in USA, Belgium, and Switzerland. The hazardous waste is used as an auxiliary fuel along with other feed stocks like clays, pumice, scoria, shale, and slate, in the production of cement. Some mobile incinerators are used for on-site contaminated soil remediation.

The first U.S. waste-to-energy plant was operating in 1905 in New York City.

### sweden

Sweden incinerates 2 million tones of waste per year. Heating 810,000 homes and providing electricity to 250,000 homes. Importing SW from Norway.


Sweden, for example, uses energy-recovery from the controlled thermal treatment of waste to heat 1.25 million homes in the winter and electricity for nearly 700,000 homes. The city of Linköping houses one of 34 incineration facilities in Sweden, which are also fueled by waste imported from neighbouring countries. This revenue-generating activity greatly subsidizes the cost of implementing and maintaining these facilities, and also helps to provide the volume of waste that is required to sustain the combustion processes at the right temperatures.

It’s worth noting that the voracious nature of incineration, where it requires large and consistent volumes of waste input to maintain ideal combustion conditions, has not reduced Sweden’s use of other landfill-alternatives for treating waste. Sweden has increased its recycling volume to 1.6 million tonnes in recent years, or about 49% of its total generated waste. Incineration makes up 50%, leaving a measly 1% of waste going to landfill.

[Denmark depends on burning vast quantities of garbage to generate power, using highly efficient incinerators that scrub the worst of the pollutants from flue gases. Incineration accounts for about a fifth of district heating and about 5 percent of its electricity. The trouble is that Danes don't generate enough trash to power its plants. Denmark has 23 incinerators capable of burning 3.8 million tons of waste a year; it imported nearly 1 million tons in 2018, mainly from the U.K. and Germany. 'We import waste with a high content of plastic in order to use the excess capacity at the incineration plants, with increasing CO2 emission as a result," said Dan Jørgensen, Denmark's climate minister. As a result, Denmark intends to reduce its incineration capacity by 30 percent by 2030 under a June 2020 agreement to restructure the country's waste management. To cut overcapacity, it will need to close seven incinerators. The deal also includes plans to introduce a recycling system with 10 different streams of waste (glass, paper, textiles, etc.) and to slash the amount of garbage it imports. "The process of burning trash is inherently polluting — you can put state-of-the-art pollution controls on an incinerator, but that doesn’t make the facility clean," said Jens Peter Mortensen, a waste expert at the Danish Society for Nature Conservation. The issues can be clearly seen on Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic Sea. It has the country’s smallest incineration plant, which the island aims to shut in 2032.][https://www.politico.eu/article/denmark-devilish-waste-trash-energy-incineration-recycling-dilemma/]

Challenges for Sustainable Development of Waste to Energy in Developing Countries  - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0734242X20903564

## bad stories

There have been numerous examples where “proven” technologies in developed countries have failed in developing countries because sufficient attention was not paid to “soft” strategic aspects, namely, political, institutional, social, financial, economic and technical elements.
- the high moisture content, low combustibility, and seasonal variations of waste make it unsuitable for direct incineration. Waste quantity may also vary by collection and transportation system, governance ability, season or as a result of natural disasters.



the concept is failing in the developed world e.g. the amount of recyclables in Germany extracted from the waste stream is so high that the remaining calorific value of the waste stream is too low for waste-to-energy facilities. Now, these facilities require co-firing using fossil fuels, which is unsustainab.

[2015 Research showed that calorific value of MSW in Tehran, Iran is insufficient to run a financially viable incinerator.][https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Techno-economic-assessment-of-municipal-solid-waste-Tehrani-Haghi/c82cf874f2870fbac46ba6561c374d88212776be]

Incineration has been challenged in some low and middle- income countries where facilities built decades ago without proper waste characterization studies and lack of air pollution control equipment resulted in insufficient and low- quality feedstock, inefficient incineration, and high levels of air pollution. 



In Phuket, Thailand, Construction started on the first incinerator in 1996 by the Department of Public Works in the Ministry of Interior which had been in operation since 1999 with a capacity of treating 250 tonnes of MSW per day. But the total volume of waste (about 350 tonnes/day) exceeded the capacity of the incinerator, resulting in excess waste being dumped in a landfill site since 2003. A second incinerator was built by a private company and strated operating in 2012. However, the operation of this incinerator has been suspended due to facility maintenance since 2012.  Phuket City Municipality submitted an application to the central government to subsidise maintenance costs which was not granted, resulting in the suspension of operations at the first incineration plant. In the early days, food waste was collected and traditionally used as livestock feed especially for swine. However, due to a boom in tourism and urbanisation, piggeries were forced to close, and owners sold their land or moved to neighbouring provinces where land was much cheaper. Because of such social changes, surplus food waste was shifted into the main waste stream and organic components sent to incinerators almost doubled from 34% in 1993 to 64% in 2004. As a result, the quantity of dioxins and furan gas was found to exceed the national emission control standard for solid waste incinerators.


















# calorific value of waste

seasonal variations in waste content must be considered. For example, waste may contain more moisture in the rainy season. 
calorific value of waste - add a definition?
Lower Calorific Value LCV is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporisation of the water from the higher heating value. this matters, not CV!
LCV must be, on average, at least 7,000 kJ/kg and never fall below 6,000 kJ/ kg for WtE incineration to recover energy [22]


For example, incineration technology can be applied to waste with a moisture content of 75% or less and a volatile content of 20% or more, which corresponds to a LCV of 3,352 kJ/ kg or more. Furthermore, in cases where energy recovery is a part of the incineration process, these technologies are generally applicable for waste with a moisture content of 65% or less and a volatile content of 30% or more, with a LCV of 6,285 kJ/kg or more. [22]
The composition of waste in low-income countries indicates that this waste can be incinerated, but it does not fall within the scope of energy recovery from incineration.
If the amount of organic waste is about 50% to 60%, incineration becomes an option. However, it is not suitable for energy recovery, which is only possible when the ratio of plastic and paper increases and food and kitchen waste falls to approximately 50% or less.

In terms of WtE incineration, MSW can be categorised into “combustible” or “non-combustible” wastes.
Combustible waste consists of organic waste and other burnable waste such as paper, plastic, and textiles that were not separated at source as recyclable resources. Non-combustible waste includes ceramic ware (teacups, plates, flowerpots, etc.), metals, glass (bottles, flower vases, mirrors, etc.), ash, and other items. 

the ratio of organic waste (food and green) tends to be highest (56%) in low-income countries and lowest (32%) in high-income countries

Higher moisture content reduces the LCV and combustion efficiency.



There is a minimum cal. val. requirement of course. it should be > 6 MJ/ton.


If due to high moisture content the waste cannot self-sustain the required temperature during combustion, additional fuel (for example propane or waste with high calorific value) has to be added.
This often occurs when more than 50% of the waste is wet biowaste.
Separating metals, glass and biowaste prior to incineration increases the calorific value of waste.

Indonesia is home to 3.4% of the world's population; and it is estimated that 10% of the global ocean plastic pollution originates there. The Indonesia National Plastic Action Partnership mapped out this challenge.

Our beautiful nation is grappling with a serious plastic pollution challenge. We are home to the world’s largest archipelago – more than 17,000 islands, 81,000 kilometres of coastlines and a rich abundance of biodiverse marine ecosystems. 

President Joko Widodo has set the course with two crucial pieces of legislation. The Indonesia National Waste Management Policy and Strategy (Presidential Decree No. 97/2017) and the Plan of Action on Marine Plastic Debris 2018-2025 (Presidential Decree No. 83/2018) have put the fight against plastic pollution at the top of the national agenda, creating the enabling environment that we needed as policy-makers to deliver on this ambitious vision.

The first step in this process was to bring the right stakeholders onboard. In March last year, we joined the Global Plastic Action Partnership, a new public-private collaboration platform hosted at the World Economic Forum, as its first national partner. We became the first country in the world to test-drive the National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP) model – a nimble, inclusive and solutions-driven approach to solving the challenge of plastic pollution.Through the NPAP, we have created a platform for bringing together Indonesia’s top minds to take on plastic pollution together, from researchers to businesses to civil society. Collectively, we have created a national roadmap that lays out the concrete steps we need to take – in policy-making, manufacturing, awareness-building and driving investment – to achieve a plastic pollution-free Indonesia.

### Collection

[In Indonesia, communities are generally responsible for collecting waste from each household and sending it to local transfer stations or temporary disposal sites. Local governmental waste-collection agencies are usually responsible only for gathering the waste in larger trucks from these aggregation points, as well as from main roadways, markets and other public facilities, and transporting it to dedicated landfills.][https://news.mongabay.com/2020/02/in-bali-young-people-lead-the-fight-as-a-plastic-plague-threatens-paradise/]

According to the data published by the [UNdata][http://data.un.org/Host.aspx?Content=About] the amount of MSW collected in Indonesia has [increase from 2477 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 6027 thousand tonnes in 2015][http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=ENV&f=variableID%3a1814] (assuming that 1 cubic meter of waste weights 0.24 tonnes, which is in line with another study that found that [1 cubic meter of waste in Manado City weights 0.313 tonnes][https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/icest-17/25884959]).
However this data includes only large cities and the number of cities included has been different every year - from 2 cities included in 1990 to 33 cities included in 2011.

Rigid plastic is recycled into bettle packaging, bottle caps and non-food contact items using Blown molding. 
Rigit plasti is also recycled into waste bins, flower pots, containers and houseware using injection molding.
Film plastic is recycled into trash bags and concrete sheets using extrusion and blown film techniques.



### Treatment 




[On July 16th 2019 cabinet meeting, Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed the hope that building waste-fueled power plants in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bekasi and Surakarta might be finished by the end of 2019. The one in Bali will follow, and then the other 7. The President Joko Widodo emphasised that the aim is to solve the waste challedge in these cities, not to make profit on electricity sales. Bantar Gebang, the largest uncovered landfill site in Southeast Asia, receives 8,000 tons of waste per day. Additionally Bekasi itself generates 1,700 tons per day.][https://setkab.go.id/4-kota-sudah-siap-seskab-tipping-fee-jadi-masalah-klasik-pembangunan-pltsa/]
These four waste-fueled power plants will feed into [Java and Bali grid that is already over-supplied][https://news.mongabay.com/2017/11/indonesia-coal-power-push-neglects-rural-households-chokes-urban-ones/] while not addressing the shortage of electricity in under-served areas like Sulawesi.

[The energy ministry expects to have 12 such waste-to-energy plants online by 2022, generating a combined 234 megawatts of electricity by burning 16,000 tons of waste a day.][https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/indonesia-facing-a-waste-crisis-plans-to-burn-it-for-electricity/]

[In 2005 after 3 days of heavy rain Leuwigajah  dumpsite  in  Bandung  (Indonesia)  collapsed creating an avalanche of 2.7  millon  cubic  meters of waste. It killed 147  people and destroyed a near by settlement.][http://dr-koelsch.de/assets/images/sardinia_2005.pdf]

Land for new waste disposal sites for MSW is becoming difficult. 
Indonesia is already planning to move its capital to the island of Borneo, as Jakarta - on the north coast of Java island - is slowly sinking and suffers regular flooding. In Borneo landfills will come at a cost of deforestation.


### Bali

10 landfills.




[https://www.systemiq.earth/bali-governor/]:
Bali residents, tourists and organisations generate 1.6 million tonnes of waste per year (TPY), of which 303,000 tonnes is plastic (19.6% of total waste).
33,000 tonnes of plastic are leaking into waterways from Bali every year (11% of total plastic waste).
Approximately 48% of Bali’s waste is responsibly managed either through recycling or landfill. However, a significant portion of collected waste never reaches a recycling facility or any of Bali’s 10 official landfills. Among the findings, the results show just over 48% of waste generated in Bali, a popular tourist hotspot, is managed responsibly, either through recycling or landfill, while the rest is burned or pollutes land, waterways and the ocean. As a result, 33,000 tons of Bali’s plastic waste ends up in the ocean each year.
7% of Bali’s plastic waste is collected for recycling, with 20% of household leveraging the informal sector to recycle their waste, and 6% using waste banks.
Each person of Bali’s 16 million tourists (6 million international and 10 million domestic) generates 3.5x more waste per day than a Bali resident, the total waste generation from tourists account for 13% of Bali’s total waste.
Bali residents are ready for change: 87% are willing to sort waste and are ready to make the effort to reduce, reuse and recycle.
Focused effort to solving waste challenges in 15 of the 57 sub-districts of Bali will reduce Bali’s ocean plastic by 44%.
More than 400 community, private-sector, government and cultural and religious organisations are active in clean-ups, education, waste collection, and recycling. They need support to focus their activities on the 15 sub-districts where the need is greatest.


According to the Bali Tourism Board, more than 6.5 million international tourists visited the island in 2018, an increase of more than 10% from 2017.


[Less than half of Bali’s generated garbage is disposed of properly — either recycled or sent to landfills — while the rest is burned or dumped in nature. This results in 33,000 tons of plastic waste entering the ocean each year. As the numbers of tourists has steadily grown (up 10% in 2018 from the previous year), so has the amount of trash; tourists produce 3.5 times the waste of locals, accounting for 13% of the total trash output.][https://news.mongabay.com/2020/02/in-bali-young-people-lead-the-fight-as-a-plastic-plague-threatens-paradise/]
[Bali generates 1.6 million tonnes of waste a year, nearly a fifth of which is plastic, according to recent research by the provincial government. Some 33,000 tonnes of plastic ends up in the island’s waterways and seas every year.][https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/in-indonesia-a-court-victory-for-balis-ban-on-single-use-plastics/]

80.67% - Inadequately managed waste (Using a model developed for this study)
Mismanaged plastic waste in 2010 - 3216855.60512372 tonnes (Calculated values)
Mismanaged plastic waste in 2025 - 7415202.28255364 tonnes (Calculated values)

Currently, around 39% of the total plastic waste in Indonesia is collected; in rural and remote areas, this figure is as low as 16% (Data from JAKSTRADA database (Indonesia Ministry of Environment and Forestry), PUPR Waste portal (Indonesia Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing), and What a Waste Global Database (World Bank)).

[In late 2019, the Indonesian government has introduced new procedures for scrap exporters to register with the Indonesian Embassy and Consulates. Exporters of any scrap commodities to customers in Indonesia may apply for this registration. As per a requirement of Indonesia’s scrap import regulations, For shipments arriving in Indonesia after Oct. 1 2020, the importer will need a revised license that includes proof of the exporter's registration.][https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/indonesian-embassy-procedures-scrap-export-registration/]

[Local people cherry-pick the best bits to sell to local plastics factories. The leftover piles of poor-quality waste provide a cheap and plentiful fuel source for local businesses. In the East Java village of Tropodo, a cluster of tofu factories generates plumes of black smoke from burning plastic fuel, thus food chain is contaminated. The incinerated plastic causes respiratory problems for people who inhale its toxic smoke.][https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/plastic-waste-indonesia-pollution-health]

[Over 2,000 containers of plastic and paper waste had been stopped at Indonesian sea ports for thorough inspections, 584 of which had been ordered to be shipped back to countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan, said Heru Pambudi, the head of Indonesia’s customs office in 2019. Nexus3 and Basel Action Network (BAN) found evidence that out of 58 waste containers due to be returned from Indonesia to the United States, only 12 had made their way back, while 38 had gone instead to India. The rest were found in South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico, the Netherlands and Canada. After this report has been released, Rosa Vivien Ratnawati, director general of waste management at Indonesia’s environment ministry said in October 2019 it would report countries to the Basel Convention, an international treaty on waste reduction, if they refused to accept waste shipments sent back to them by its authorities. Rosa Vivien Ratnawati also warned Indonesian importers that if they are ordered to send containers of trash back to where they came from, they could be criminally charged if those containers are redirected elsewhere.][https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-environment-plastic/indonesia-threatens-to-report-countries-for-refusing-to-take-back-waste-idUSKBN1XA15K]

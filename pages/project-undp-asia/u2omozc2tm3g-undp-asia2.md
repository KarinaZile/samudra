This is part 2 out of 6. Here is [part 1](/ufr1hrx4bpsto-undp-asia/).

Deadline: July 1st

Summary in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nFeXDRwVYPD_pxukZpu9cWO4C4SOV4zR5ykb16B09JI/edit?usp=sharing) format.



# Vietnam

Total MSW generated in 2013 - 12.8 million tonnes, with 15.6% plastics; collection rate 76% in urban and 40% in rural areas (according to "National environment report, 2011: Solid Waste, MONRE, 2011").

## Administrative units of the country

First tier: Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces and 5 municipalities under the command of the central government. Municipalities are centrally-controlled cities and have special status equal to the provinces. The 5 municipalities are:
* Ho Chi Minh City, population 9 million, density 4,100/km2
* Hanoi, population 8 million, density 2,300/km2
* Haiphong, population 2 million, density 1,500/km2
* Can Tho, population 1.3 million, density 900/km2
* Da Nang, population 1.2 million, density 1,200/km2

Second tier: The provinces are divided into provincial cities or towns and rural districts. The municipalities are divided into urban districts, municipal cities, towns and rural districts. 

Third tier: Provincial city or town is divided into wards and communes. Rural district is divided into townships and communes. The municipalities are divided into wards, communes and townships.

## Population density

<p style="color:#AEAEAE">
Total area of the country = 331,699 km2<br/>
Area of 5 cities = 3,345 + 2,095 + 1,390 + 1,256 + 1,508 = 9,594 km2<br/>
Area of the country (except 5 cities) = 331,699 - 9,594 = 322,105 km2<br/>

Total population = 97,300,000<br/>
Population of 5 cities = 8,053,663 + 8,993,082 + 1,235,171 +  1,134,310 + 2,028,514 = 21,444,740<br/>
Population (except 5 cities) = 97,300,000 - 21,444,740 = 75,855,260<br/>
Population density (outside 5 municipalities) = 75,855,260 / 322,105 = 235 people/km2 (not 295, which is the typical estimate)<br/>
</p>

Population density outside the 5 municipalities (big cities) is 235 people/km2. Typical estimate is 295, but that does not account for higher population density in bigest cities.


## Relevant institutions

In Vietnam waste policies are binding on national level.

On National level:
* Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) - MONRE takes overall responsibility for waste management and direct management of hazardous waste through the Vietnam Environmental Administration (VEA).
* Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) - industrial waste
* Ministry of Construction (MOC) - development of master plans, standards for waste treatment facilities and management of construction and demolition waste
* Ministry of Finance (MOF)
* Ministry of Health (MOH) - waste from hospitals and medical establishments
* Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI)
* Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) - agricultural and rural waste
* Ministry of Transportation (MOT)
* Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
* Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)
* Ministry of Information and Communications (MOIC)
* Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI)

First tier:
* People’s Committees of provinces / Provincial People’s Committee (PCCs) 
* Municipal People’s Committee (PC)
* The Departments of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE) at municipal and provincial levels is responsible for the management of environmental protection activities in the local areas.
* Department of Construction (DOC)

**According to [GIZ 2018 study](https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/giz2018_Vietnam-Country-Profile_web.pdf):**

Provincial waste management spending is often met by the Central and local State budget.

Almost 90% of the budget is spent for waste collection and transportation, very little is left for waste treat- ment and disposal.

Cities also collect a "sanitary" fee for waste management service delivery from waste generators. The fee ranges around 21,000 VND (0.90 USD) per household per month in urban areas and 0.7 USD in rural areas. The waste fee is equivalent to 0.5% of the average household expenditure. 

The waste fee covers less than 60% of the total waste management costs (in some municipalities it is enough to cover only 20-30% of the total operation cost).

In urban areas, collection and transportation of domestic waste is mainly run by private companies and cooperatives (formed by the informal waste picker community).

Urban Environment Company (URENCO or CITENCO) - the main state-owned company in charge of waste collection, maintaining hygiene in public places, public lighting, planting and maintenance of roadside trees, and transport, and treatment in the province or city.

Other private companies are involved in waste collection. In Ho Chi Minh City, 50% of MSW is collected by private companies, while in Hanoi the proportion is 20% (17 private companies and 7 public entities).

Between 2003-2012, Vietnam had received 213 million USD of solid waste management focused development finance (19 grants, 182 concessional loans, 12 non-concessional loans).

Public Private Partnership (PPP) is another funding mechanism sought by the Vietnamese government.

Established in 2002, the Vietnam Environment Protection Fund (VEPF) is one of the important investment sources that provides soft loans, interest rate support, funding and co-funding, price subsidies for environment protection products, entrusted loans for waste treatment, wastewater treatment facilities.


## Plastics and packaging

**According to [GIZ 2018 study](https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/giz2018_Vietnam-Country-Profile_web.pdf):**

Plastic industry: Over 2,000 firms operating in the country (2016), with an annual growth of 16-18% in the period of 2010-2015, 12.6 billion USD business volume.

Imports: Import of plastic resins, packaging machinery and equipment from Korea (22%), Taiwan (17%), Thailand (11%), Singapore (13%) and Saudi Arabia (12%); PT Indorama from Thailand and Hyosung from Korea are the biggest resin supplier for PET bottle manufacturers in Vietnam.


Packaging industry value: 4.7 billion USD (2016), plastic packaging is the largest and fastest growing segment

Packaging industry growth rate (average): 10% (one of the emerging industries)

Composition of packaging industry (by type): Plastic packaging (4.7 billion US$, 64%), Paper and corrugated boxes (1.2 billion US$, 16%), Metal packaging (1.1 billion US$, 14%), glass packaging (0.5 billion US$, 6%)

Share of packaging in plastic production: 38% of total plastic production is for packaging (the largest share), followed by 29% for household products, and 18% for construction

Flexible packaging market size: Estimated at 953 million USD (2016), 400 companies producing flexible packaging; 14 players dominate 54% of flexible packaging market

Sectoral consumption of plastic packaging: Food and beverage sector, followed by non-food sector (beauty, personal care, home care)

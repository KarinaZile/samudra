This is part 2 out of 6. Here is [part 1][1].

Deadline: ?


Summary in a [spreadsheet][2] format.



### Indonesia

Sources of data: [Radically Reducing Plastic Pollution in Indonesia: A Multistakeholder Action Plan (2020)][6] by WEF

More than 25.1 million tonnes of MSW are created in Indonesia per year. 
[6.8 million tonnes of plastic waste][3] (?27% of MSW) are produced per year, growing by 5% annually, at a rate similar to Indonesia's GDP growth. 
The above estimate excludes 30-50% of plastic waste - long-life products (cars, tyres, e-waste), industrial waste (manufacturing, agriculture) and sea-based waste (fishing nets, waste from ships).

In 2017, of [these 6.8 million tonnes][3], 2.176 were formally collected (32%), 0.476 were collected by the informal sector directly from residential areas (7%, high-value recyclable plastics only), 4.148 were uncollected (61%). 
Out of 2.176 million tonnes that were formally collected, 0.544 are recovered for recycling by the informal sector (8%,  high-value recyclable plastics only), 1.156 are properly disposed off (17%), 0.476 are disposed off in poorly managed official dumpsites (7%), and a small amount (<1%) were sorted from the rest of MSW in government-run waste processing sites (Tempat Pengolahan Sampah - Reduce Reuse Recycle; TPS3R). 
In early 2020 there was no incineration at scale in Indonesia. 
Out of 4.148 million tonnes that were uncollected, 3.196 were openly burned (47%), 0.340 were dumped on land (5%), and 0.612 leaked into the marine environment (9%). 
The amount of plastic waste entering the marine environment is estimated to grow by 30% by 2025.

Nearly all waste collected by the informal sector ends up at a recycling facility, but 30% of that is eventually disposed of during sorting and due to contamination. 
Of recycled plastics, around 85% are processed in a way that makes it difficult to recycle the product again.

In 2018 Indonesia switched from a net-exporter of plastic waste to a net-importer. 
Imported plastic waste is about 5% of domesticly generated amount - [the official figure is 3.1%, which excludes illegal imports][4].

There are [big differnces between urban and rural areas][5]. 
In urban areas, 50% more waste is generated per person, waste collection rate is higher (up to 74% in cities with more than 1 million people), there is an active informal sector. 
In rural areas, less waste is generated per person, waste collection rates of 16% are not uncommon, the informal sector plays very limited role in waste management. 
This combination of factors means that 72% of uncollected plastic waste is outside cities with more than 1 million people.

Flexible plastic represent 76% of plastic pollution.

Waste data is available from Ministry of Environment and Forestry (Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional, SIPSN).


### Thailand

Plastic is [17.4% of MSW][7].

[Data][7] (including modelling) for the catchment areas of 4 rivers (Phetchaburi, Tha Chin, Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong), indicates that 89% of plastic waste (as part of MSW) is formally collected and 11% is not collected.
Out of 89% that are formally collected. 21.4% are recycled, 52.6% are disposed to sanitary facilities, 15% are disposed to unsanitary facilities.
Out of 11% that are uncollected, 8.7% are openly burnt, 1.5% are dumped on land, 0.2% is dumped into rivers.

[70.1% of marine plastic pollution][7] originates from rural areas.
Despite high collection rates, Bangkok accounts for [18.4% of marine plastic pollution][7] due to the large absolute volumes of waste.
A large amount of uncollected waste in Chao Phraya is disposed directly into waterways.

Specific targets related to "Greenifying the people’s lifestyle and promote sustainable consumption" include:
* Key target until 2030: The rate of municipal solid waste that is collected and treated in compliance with the regulated standards reaches 95%; the proportion of municipal solid waste that is treated with the direct burial method accounts for only 10% of the waste collected.
* Key target until 2050: The rate of solid waste that is collected and treated in compliance with national standards reaches 100%, while the burial of organic solid waste and recyclable waste are reduced to a minimum.

The development orientation of key industries and sectors (under "Strategic orientation" section):
* Step by step put limits on economic sectors that generate large scale waste and cause environmental pollution/degradation; facilitate the conditions for the development of new green manufacturing industries.
* Strengthen waste management through researching and developing integrated solid waste management models as well as waste treatment technologies with an orientation towards transforming waste into resources and materials for production; promote the implementation of measures to classify solid waste at its source, as well as to reuse and recycle solid waste.

Tasks for Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) include:
* Direct waste management and treatment in accordance with the assigned functions, tasks and authorities; handle critical and urgent environmental issues related to solid waste management.

Tasks for Ministry of Health (MOH) include:
* Formulate systems for the management and supervision of medical waste classification, disposal and treatment activities in compliance with national and international standards; build and deploy models of green technologies application and clean energy utilization in the treatment of medical waste

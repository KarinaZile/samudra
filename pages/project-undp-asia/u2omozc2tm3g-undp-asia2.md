Summary in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nFeXDRwVYPD_pxukZpu9cWO4C4SOV4zR5ykb16B09JI/edit?usp=sharing) format.


## India

India produces 189.75 million of tonnes of MSW per year, approximately 0.377 kg/day per person. 
Waste collection rate in urban areas is 78%, but only 34.9% people live in an urban setting. 
77% of collected waste is disposed of in dumpsites, 18% of waste is recycled and 5% is composted. 

India has a 17,181 km long coastline, with many big cities dotted along.
According to J. R. Jambeck [projection](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352), based on 2010 data, yearly amount of country's oceanbound plastic waste will reach 2.881 million tonnes by 2025.

A [list of policies relevant to waste management sector](https://www.fao.org/faolex/country-profiles/general-profile/see-more/en/?iso3=IND&countryname=India&area=Environment&link=aHR0cDovL2Zhb2xleC5mYW8ub3JnL2NnaS1iaW4veG1sLmV4ZT9kYXRhYmFzZT1mYW9sZXgmYW1wO3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPXF1ZXJ5JmFtcDt0YWJsZT1hbGwmYW1wO3F1ZXJ5PUFSRUE6RU4gQU5EIElTTzpJTkQgQU5EIFQ6QUxMIEFORCBSRVBFQUxFRDpOIEFORCBTVVBFUlM6TiBOT1QgUk86WSBBTkQgWjooTCBSIE0pIE5PVCBaOlAmYW1wO3NvcnRfbmFtZT1Ac3ByZkVOJmFtcDtsYW5nPXhtbGYmYW1wO2Zvcm1hdF9uYW1lPUBYU0hPUlQmYW1wO3BhZ2VfaGVhZGVyPUVYTUxIJmFtcDtwYWdlX2Zvb3Rlcj1FWE1MRg==) has been compiled by FAO.
Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has issued EPR guidlines for plastic packaging.

## Indonesia

Indonesia produces 65.2 million of tonnes of MSW per year, approximately 0.653 kg/day per person. 
14% of it is plastic.
The total amount of plastic waste is growing by 5% annually, at a rate similar to Indonesia's GDP growth.
Waste data is available from Ministry of Environment and Forestry (Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional, SIPSN).
Only 45% of population are covered by waste collection services. 
79% of collected waste is disposed of in dumpsites/landfills, 7% of waste recycled. 

According to [WEF](https://globalplasticaction.org/wp-content/uploads/NPAP-Indonesia-Multistakeholder-Action-Plan_April-2020.pdf) 6.8 million tonnes of plastic waste were produced in Indonesia in 2020.
The above estimate excludes 30-50% of plastic waste - long-life products (cars, tyres, e-waste), industrial waste (manufacturing, agriculture) and sea-based waste (fishing nets, waste from ships).
In 2017, of [these 6.8 million tonnes][3], 2.176 were formally collected (32%), 0.476 were collected by the informal sector directly from residential areas (7%, high-value recyclable plastics only), 4.148 were uncollected (61%).
Out of 2.176 million tonnes that were formally collected, 0.544 are recovered for recycling by the informal sector (8%,  high-value recyclable plastics only), 1.156 are properly disposed off (17%), 0.476 are disposed off in poorly managed official dumpsites (7%), and a small amount (<1%) were sorted from the rest of MSW in government-run waste processing sites (Tempat Pengolahan Sampah - Reduce Reuse Recycle; TPS3R).

With a 95,181 km long coastline, Indonesia is the 4th biggest by coastline length. 
Out of 4.148 million tonnes that were uncollected, 3.196 were openly burned (47%), 0.340 were dumped on land (5%), and 0.612 leaked into the marine environment (9%).
The amount of plastic waste entering the marine environment is estimated to grow by 30% by 2025.
According to J. R. Jambeck [projection](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352), based on 2010 data, yearly amount of country's oceanbound plastic waste will reach 7.415 million tonnes by 2025. 

Nearly all waste collected by the informal sector ends up at a recycling facility, but 30% of that is eventually disposed of during sorting and due to contamination.
Of recycled plastics, around 85% are processed in a way that makes it difficult to recycle the product again.
In 2018 Indonesia switched from a net-exporter of plastic waste to a net-importer.
Imported plastic waste is about 5% of domesticly generated amount - the official figure is 3.1%, which excludes illegal imports.

There are big differnces between urban and rural areas.
In urban areas, 50% more waste is generated per person, waste collection rate is higher (up to 74% in cities with more than 1 million people), there is an active informal sector.
In rural areas, less waste is generated per person, waste collection rates of 16% are not uncommon, the informal sector plays very limited role in waste management.
This combination of factors means that 72% of uncollected plastic waste is outside cities with more than 1 million people.
Flexible plastic represent 76% of plastic pollution.

According to [Indonesia’s Plan of Action on Marine Plastic Debris 2017-2025](https://maritim.go.id/portfolio/indonesias-plan-action-marine-plastic-debris-2017-2025/) published by the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs (Kementerian Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan Investasi) the list of strategies includes:
* implementation of the paid plastic bag policy,
* encouraging use of recycled materials in plastic production,
* encouraging production of biodegradable plastics,
* disposing of plastic waste through waste-to-energy facilities and by using it in road construction,
* attention to plastic waste from ports, and fishing and shipping industries.

## Pakistan


Pakistan produces 30.76 million of tonnes of MSW per year, approximately 0.382 kg/day per person. 
9% of it is plastic. 
Waste collection rate in urban areas is 70% and 30% in rural areas. 
90% of collected waste is disposed of in dumpsites, 8% of waste is recycled and 2% is composted. 

Pakistan has a 2,599 km long coastline.
According to J. R. Jambeck [projection](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352), based on 2010 data, yearly amount of country's oceanbound plastic waste will reach 1.221 million tonnes by 2025.

In 2013, Pakistan introduced [Prohibition of Non-degradable Plastic Products (manufacturing, sale and usage) Regulations](http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/pak168042.pdf).
The regulations defined non-degradable plastic products as those that are not oxo-biodegradable.
Pakistan’s Federal Minister for Climate Change Rana Muhammad Farooq Saeed Khan [stated](https://www.labelsandlabeling.com/news/latest/pakistan-moves-ban-non-degradable-plastic-products) that the only change required is to add a pro-degradant additive (1-3%) "to develop biodegradable properties in plastic".

In 2018, the [Report From The European Commission](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0035&from=LT) showed that oxo-degradable plastic is not suited for long-term use, recycling or composting.
In 2019, this was followed by the [Single-Use Plastic Directive (EU) 2019/904](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904&from=EN) (Article 5) banning the Member States from placing products made from oxo-degradable plastic on the market, "as this type of plastic does not properly biodegrade and thus contributes to microplastic pollution in the environment, is not compostable, negatively affects the recycling of conventional plastic and fails to deliver a proven environmental benefit".
A similar [ban is likely in the UK](https://www.plasticstoday.com/sustainability/organizations-call-uk-ban-plastics-containing-oxo-biodegradable-additives) in near future.
It is unclear whether Thailand banned oxo-degradable plastics [in 2019](https://th.boell.org/en/2021/10/26/thailands-plastic-waste-conundrum) or if the ban is expected [in 2025](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2127891/oxo-degradable-plastics-worry-firms).





## Bangladesh

Bangladesh produces 15 million of tonnes of MSW per year, approximately 0.246 kg/day per person.

## Thailand

Thailand has a 7,066 km long coastline.
According to J. R. Jambeck [projection](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352), based on 2010 data, yearly amount of country's oceanbound plastic waste will reach 2.179 million tonnes by 2025.

According to [Plastic Waste Material Flow Analysis for Thailand](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099515103152238081/pdf/P17099409744b50fc09e7208a58cb52ae8a.pdf) report by The World Bank (2022), plastic is 17.4% of MSW.
Data (including modelling) for the catchment areas of 4 rivers (Phetchaburi, Tha Chin, Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong), indicates that 89% of plastic waste (as part of MSW) is formally collected and 11% is not collected.
Out of 89% that are formally collected. 21.4% are recycled, 52.6% are disposed to sanitary facilities, 15% are disposed to unsanitary facilities.
Out of 11% that are uncollected, 8.7% are openly burnt, 1.5% are dumped on land, 0.2% is dumped into rivers.
70.1% of marine plastic pollution originates from rural areas.
Despite high collection rates, Bangkok accounts for 18.4% of marine plastic pollution due to the large absolute volumes of waste.
A large amount of uncollected waste in Chao Phraya is disposed directly into waterways.

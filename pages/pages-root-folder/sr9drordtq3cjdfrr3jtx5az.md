Here is a list of funding sources that could be used for waste management projects. 
As I've just started working on this list, the entries appear in random order and many are still missing.


### Opportunities with a specific deadline

**1.** [The GSMA Innovation Fund for Digital Urban Services][9]  
**Deadline:** <span style="color:red">2 July 2021</span>  
**What they fund:** Innovative digital tools to incentivise, facilitate and optimise the collection, transport, sorting and recycling of waste. For example, tools to allow waste pickers to digitally log their waste collection, to relay their locations to help manage logistics and identify waste hotspots, to connect them to buyers of recyclable materials; digital payment platforms for waste collection to facilitate access to fair market prices; digital traceability tools to create an auditable trail of recovered waste or to increase transparency in the plastics supply chain.  
**Who can apply:** Startups, SMEs and social enterprises supporting the provision of essential urban services to the underserved populations across Africa or Asia using innovative digital technology. The organisation must have active users and commercial revenue (revenue generated from any products or services offered by the organisation) in at least one eligible low- or middle-income country.    
**Type of funding:** GBP 100,000 - 250,000 in equity-free grants. Matching funding of 25% - 50% is required.  
**Previously funded:** [Coliba][10] in Côte d'Ivoire - a company that designed a web, mobile and SMS platform that connects households and businesses with plastic waste collectors.   
**To apply:** Complete a short online questionnaire describing the project and how you meet the funding criteria. If successful, you'll have to submit a full proposal in August and start the project in March 2022.  





### Innovation funds - for projects that haven't been done before


**1.** [The Global Innovation Fund][3] (GIF) is a non-profit innovation fund. Offices in London, UK (HQ) and Washington DC.  
**What they fund:** 
Breakthrough solutions to global development challenges, i.e. innovations targeted at improving the lives of those who live on less than USD 5 a day in developing countries, with a particular focus on those who live on less than USD 2 a day and vulnerable groups.
The innovation can be a technology, a new business model, policy practices, behavioral insight or ways of delivering products and services. 
The innovation can be in any sector, as long as it is implemented in a developing country. 
Three main criteria are: the innovation has to be demonstrably better than existing practice (backed up by evidence of impact), potential to scale to reach millions of people, and an outstanding team. 
GIF seeks to fill market gaps by supporting innovations that may otherwise struggle to find appropriate forms of funding.   
**Who can apply:** 
Any type of for-profit or non-profit organisation in any country, but not individuals. 
For-profit companies, social enterprises, non-profit organisations, government agencies, international organisations, research institutions, etc. 
There are three financing stages: pilot/development, test and transition, and scaling up. For each of those there is a different threshold for what sort of progress made to date is expected.   
**Type of funding:** 
USD 40,000 – 14 million. 
Grants, loans (including convertible debt), equity investments, hybrid capital, blended finance solutions. 
For-profit companies can apply for debt or equity for setting up or growing their business; and for grants for activities that benefit the public (creating a new market, working in partnership with the government, producing public goods) or for undertaking evaluation activities to understand the impact of their innovation on people living in poverty.  
**Previously funded:** 
[Mr Green Africa][5] in Kenya; they buy plastic waste from the informal sector, mechanically recycle it into pellets and flakes, and sell to plastics manufacturers in the FMCG sector.  
**To apply:**

<!--  **2.** [Fund for Innovation in Development / Fonds d’Innovation pour le Développement][6] (FID) is a non-profit innovation fund. Chaired by MIT economist and Nobel laureate Esther Duflo. Hosted by the [French Development Agency][7] in Paris, France. Founded in 2021.  
**What they fund:** Testing and scaling up of innovative solutions to poverty and inequality.  
**Who can apply:** 
**Type of funding:** 
**Previously funded:** 
**To apply:** 



The innovations it will fund can come from any sector, and their scope is not strictly defined: they may be technical, social, environmental, or involve governance, processes, or other issues. 
But FID prioritizes the sectors of education (with emphasis on girls’ schooling), health, the environment, and gender equality.



grants



Public and private sectors, including universities and researchers. Particular focus on projects in 19 priority countries for French aid, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. https://www.afd.fr/en/grants-development-poorest-countries




 three main criteria: evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness in achieving development outcomes compared to existing approaches, and potential for scale and sustainability. The higher the grant — which could be up to €4 million

  the grants are “the equivalent of venture capital for social innovation.”


  innovation in policy processes,, education etc

  focus on innovative ideas on really complicated issues such as adaptation [to] climate change, education, health [and] gender equality, that can really transform public policy.


“Stage 0” grants of up to €50,000. These will help researchers, primarily from the priority countries, improve their proposals before applying for larger amounts. 

Funding in the form of grants will be made available to proposed projects from all types of organizations, including research institutions, NGOs, governments, businesses and others. The budget for FID’s first year is €15 million.

### Development banks - for projects in low and middle income countries

The [list of public development banks][1] around the world includes 454 organisations. Most of them are national, only 46 public development banks are international. According to [Finance in Common][2] public development banks account for 10% of global annual public and private investments.

  text: We contribute to 15 out of 17 SDGs by improving waste management systems around the world, increasing the coverage of waste collection services, reducing climate impact and environmental pollution associated with waste, minimising the impact of waste on human and ecosystem health, and creating collaborative solutions where everyone’s contribution is truly appreciated instead of being expected.

  text: Thousands of stakeholders (national and local governments, companies big and small, funders, IGOs, NGOs, universities, etc.) are already working towards addressing waste management challenges around the world. Often their impact is limited not by the lack of funding or talent, but by each other - their many efforts cancel each other out. Our mission is to increase everyone's positive impact by aligning these efforts instead.

<br/>
The waste management sector accounts for 5-15% of human-made climate impact, and the sector's total negative impact on climate, environment and health is rapidly increasing. 
Our goal is to **increase municipal solid waste collection rates in low and middle income countries**, as currently 1 in 3 people globally have no access to waste collection services. 
To achieve this goal we are building a **global action network** - a new type of organisation, that is neither government, nor business, nor civil society, but a structure that combines the resources and competences of all of these.

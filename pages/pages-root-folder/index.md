Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
As our first challenge we picked marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 
About 80% of plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans originates on land, a lot of it is due to the lack of waste collection services in populated areas. 
This brings us to Indonesia, where about 10% of global marine plastic pollution originates. 
Our initial goal is to improve coverage and efficiency of the waste collection and treatment system, since only 32% of municipal solid waste is currently collected in Indonesia.

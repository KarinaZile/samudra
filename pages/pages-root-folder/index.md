Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
Our current focus is on marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 
About {{site.data.language.percentage_of_plastic_pollution_originating_on_land}} of plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans originates on land, a lot of it is due to the lack of waste collection services in populated areas. 
This brings us to Indonesia, where about {{site.data.language.percentage_of_plastic_pollution_originating_in_indonesia}} of global marine plastic pollution originates. 
Our initial goal is to improve coverage and efficiency of the waste collection and treatment system, since only {{site.data.language.percentage_of_msw_collected_in_indonesia}} of municipal solid waste is currently collected in Indonesia.

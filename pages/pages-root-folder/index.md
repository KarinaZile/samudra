  title: Our work focuses on 15 SDGs set by the UN
  text: By improving waste management systems around the world, increasing the coverage of waste collection services, reducing the environmental pollution associated with waste and creating collaborative solutions where everyone’s contribution is truly appreciated instead of being expected, we contribute to 15 SDGs set by the UN.

  title: Waste contributes >3% to the climate emergency
  text: According to <a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&historical-emissions-gases=all-ghg&historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&historical-emissions-sectors=%2Cwaste&page=1" target="_blank">Climate Watch</a>, waste accounted for 3% of global GHG emissions in 2017. <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/30317" target="_blank">World Bank's estimate</a> is 5%. <a href="https://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/seel-global-review" target="_blank">New research on open burning of waste</a> suggests that this practice alone could account for 2-10% of global GHG emissions. While research aimed at quantifying GHG emission from waste is still ongoing, at Samudra we are determined to act before it is too late.

  title: Our approach is unique
  text: We believe that all the pieces of the puzzle already exist - local waste management companies around the world that care about the environment; funding available from governments, companies, NGOs and other stakeholders; technologies developed in companies, universities and sheds around the world. Our mission is to connect them and thus increase everyone's positive impact.

<br/>
Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don’t have a profitable solution. 
Our goals are to reduce the environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste, and to minimise the impact of waste on human and animal health.
About 1 in 3 people worldwide have no access to waste collection services, which leads to open burning of waste and dumping.
This results in air pollution, ocean pollution, soil and groundwater contamination, as well as damage to human and animal health and greenhouse gas emissions that could have been prevented.
Hence our current focus is on increasing the coverage of waste collection services ([SGD 11.6.1][1]) in low and medium income countries.

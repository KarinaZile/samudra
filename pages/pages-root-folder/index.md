  text: Thousands of stakeholders (national and local governments, companies big and small, funders, IGOs, NGOs, universities, etc.) are already working towards addressing waste management challenges around the world. Often their impact is limited not by the lack of funding or talent, but by each other - their many efforts cancel each other out. Our mission is to increase everyone's positive impact by aligning these efforts instead.

<br/>
Samudra is an international organisation dedicated to improving waste management systems globally.
Our goals are to reduce climate impact and environmental pollution associated with waste, and to minimise the impact of waste on human and ecosystem health.
We plan to achieve these goals by:

* Developing and implementing a global waste management strategy that will amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders in the waste management sector (national and local governments, companies big and small, funders, IGOs, NGOs, universities, etc.) and prevent different efforts from cancelling each other out.
* Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure that will allow us to put important conversations (about technologies, infrastructure, financing mechanisms, governance and structural change) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments lacking an actionable plan to achieve them.
* Growing a global network of stakeholders in the waste management sector that will allow us to facilitate fruitful connections across different geographical regions and between different types of stakeholders that usually don't interact, or their interaction is typically one-sided.

The long-term aim for Samudra is to become an IGO that will act as a global orchestrator aligning efforts of major stakeholders in the waste management sector, and to have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.

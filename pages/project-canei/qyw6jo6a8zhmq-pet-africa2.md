In 2004 l'Agence Nationale de Gestion des d√©chets (AND) introduced [Eco-Jem][6], an EPR scheme in the form of a tax imposed on containers to incentivise manufacturers to pay for a system of waste collection and recovery. As of Feb 2021, Eco-Jem has yet to be implemented due to a lack of clarity regarding where the financial burden lies, with the producer or the seller.

In Algeria the amount of household and similar waste exceeded [13 million tons in 2018][8], the Algerian Ministry of the Environment estimates that it could reach 20 million tonnes by 2030. In 2022, the Algerian government plans to allocate [230 million USD][8] to the city of Algiers - 210 to build an integrated waste management complex, and 20 to build tanks 3 and 4 at the Hamici Technical Landfill Center (the site is equipped with landfill bins, a weighbridge and three sorting lines with a capacity of 24 tonnes per hour). 

I spoke to a person from [Global Environment Facility (GEF)][11] who evaluates waste management projects in Algeria and decides whether GEF will fund them; to my surprise and disappointment they knew nothing about the waste management situation in Algeria.

There is a [tool][4] to find local waste management companies.

Freetown City Council received 14.1bn SLL from the Government of Sierra Leone in 2019 (of those, [0.8bn SLL (68,376 USD) were spent on waste management][5]); which was added to their own budget of 22.2bn SLL.
They set a target to recycle 40% of all plastic waste in Freetown by 2022.
To achieve this 80 tricycles were given out to collect household waste across Freetown.

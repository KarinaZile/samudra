Most of our current projects are confidential, due to restrictions outside of our control.

We spent most of 2021 working with different types of stakeholders (city governments, waste management companies, startups and NGOs) to understand the waste management landscape from their different perspectives. 
Since then these types of projects form a minor part of what we do.

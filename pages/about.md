#### 1. Define success

For us success means **financially, politically and socially sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure** in every country. 
We focus on low and middle income countries where such systems and infrastructure are lacking. 
We focus on waste generated today and in the next 10 years. 
Hence our work is complementary to circular economy efforts aimed at building a waste-free future. 

For us success means holistic waste management systems that ensure that **all waste is collected** and that **materials and energy contained within waste are captured in the best possible way**. 
We focus on:
* biowaste - due to its large impact on climate and its potential to contribute to soil health and productivity;
* plastics - because it is a relatively new type of waste and it presents unique challenges and opportunities for recycling (not because it floats in water and looks dramatic in photos);
* e-waste, textiles, vehicles, tyres, demolition and disaster waste, etc. - types of waste that are rapidly becoming more prevalent;
* batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, etc. - types of waste associated with the ongoing energy transition;
* medical waste - due to its impact on health if dumped, and on climate if openly burnt;
* CO2, methane, etc. - we are exploring whether it would be useful to think of GHG emissions as waste;
* and all other types of waste (apart from radioactive waste and space debris).

For us success means **solving the problem** without baking Samudra into the solution. 
Our goal is to facilitate a large systems change, not to create a successful organisation. 
Once we've solved the problem, Samudra will be dissolved.

For us success means **systemic change**; in contrast to [99% of ongoing sustainability efforts that focus on parameter changes](https://hbr.org/2021/05/overselling-sustainability-reporting).
For us success metrics that matter are not easily quantifiable.
Instead, to measure our success, we use three proxy metrics:
* the amount of GHG emissions prevented, measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalent;
* the amount of waste prevented from leaking into the environment, measured in tonnes;
* the number of people whose exposure to toxic substances associated with waste was prevented.

We acknowledge that waste reduction, fostering circular economy, raising awareness about challenges related to waste and promoting consumer behaviour changes are essential too. 
It is just not what we are working on.

#### 2. Identify success-relevant stakeholders

We focus on stakeholders that are the most motivated to address waste management challenges and that are in the strongest position to facilitate a systemic change.
The success-relevant stakeholders we've identified so far include:
* **funders** - IGOs, development banks, governments of high-income countries, etc.;
* **problem owners** - national and local governments in low and middle income countries, companies, etc.;
* **methods leaders** - research centres, companies that design and build infrastructure, etc.;
* **capacity developers** - waste management companies, startups and startup accelerators, local governments, etc.;
* **new stakeholders** - organisations, both new ones and existing ones with new priorities, that are joining the waste management space due to the scale of the problem and the lack of progress in the past decade.

Beyond just identifying the success-relevant stakeholders, we are working towards gaining clarity on the dynamics and patterns that govern the landscape of the waste management space. 
This includes mapping global, regional and national funding flows, and mapping desicion making capacity within each country.

#### 3. Work with them 

<p style="color:#AEAEAE">More details coming shortly.</p>

<!-- We work with success-relevant stakeholders to facilitate internal changes and enable powerful **coordination** between them. 
  
  Existing organisational and funding structures do not support such powerful coordination between stakeholders, hence we are working on creating new systems, processes, relationships and tools.

  We focus on the capacities of each stakeholder (financial or human capital, expertise, decision making power, etc.) ... roles of different stakeholders need to be defined







Currently the connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions.

  Without super-imposing our ideas and values on other stakeholders, we... our Multi-sided value proposition -  a shared value proposition, but translated differently for each type of stakeholder, based on their individual motivations

  Instead of requiring unanimous agreement from all stakeholders, we will create groups of stakeholders that develop their own vision of the future and a plan for how to make it real.

  Samudra will facilitate the development and implementation of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail and ensure that the strategy keeps evolving along with changing circumstances, instead of becoming outdated. 

  Moving from silos to shared reality. - towards understanding of shared possibilities







To ensure that technical conversations are on the agendas of high level meetings (that usually focus on bold commitments without an actionable plan to achieve them) and that better decisions are made, we work towards ensuring that all stakeholders have **access to technical, financial and business expertise**. 
This includes identifying organisations/individuals with relevant expertise in technologies, engineering, chemistry, policy, finance, and innovative business models and financial instruments (for example ones that blend different types of funding or leverage partnerships). 
We work with them to facilitate the transfer of technical knowledge (between countries, waste streams and different types of stakeholders) through a virtual centre for technical expertise or otherwise.






global orchestrator aligning activities


global orchestrator to develop synergies between different efforts (especially those that don't agree with each other), making them complementary instead of contradictory. 

Often stakeholder impact is limited not by the lack of funding or talent, but by each other - their many efforts cancel each other out. Our mission is to increase everyone's positive impact by aligning these efforts instead.

Many efforts cancel each other out. 

Apart from direct collaborations, there is no coordination between stakeholders, which results in efforts that cancel each other out instead of being complementary. 

Such a stewardship organisation is necessary to amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders and to identify and address gaps, duplications and conflicts that impede the change on a global level.

Making these approaches complementary instead of contradictory will ensure that different stakeholders can increase each other's positive impact, even if they don't agree with each other.

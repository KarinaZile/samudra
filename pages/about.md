#### <a name="success"></a> 1. Define success

<img src="/images/main-direction.jpg" class="picture-in-text show-for-medium-up">

For us success means **financially, politically and socially sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure** in every country. 
We focus on low and middle income countries where such systems and infrastructure are lacking. 
We focus on waste generated today and in the next 10 years. 
Hence our work is complementary to circular economy efforts aimed at building a waste-free future. 

For us success means holistic waste management systems that ensure that **all waste is collected** and that **materials and energy contained within waste are captured in the best possible way**. 
We focus on:
* biowaste - due to its large impact on the climate and its potential to contribute to soil health and productivity;
* plastics - because it is a relatively new type of waste and it presents unique challenges and opportunities for recycling (not because it floats in water and looks dramatic in photos);
* e-waste, textiles, vehicles, tyres, demolition and disaster waste, etc. - types of waste that are rapidly becoming more prevalent;
* batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, etc. - types of waste associated with the ongoing energy transition;
* medical waste - due to its impact on health if dumped, and on the climate if openly burnt;
* CO2, methane, etc. - we are exploring whether it would be useful to think of GHG emissions as waste;
* and all other types of waste (apart from radioactive waste and space debris).

For us success means **solving the problem**, not creating a successful organisation. Once the problem has been solved, Samudra will be dissolved.

For us success means **systemic change**; in contrast to [99% of ongoing sustainability efforts that focus on parameter changes](https://hbr.org/2021/05/overselling-sustainability-reporting).
We use three proxy metrics to quantify our success:
* the amount of GHG emissions prevented, measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalent;
* the amount of waste prevented from leaking into the environment, measured in tonnes;
* the number of people whose exposure to toxic substances associated with waste was prevented.

While we acknowledge that waste reduction, fostering a circular economy, raising awareness about challenges related to waste and promoting consumer behaviour changes are essential; we focus on building financially, politically and socially sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure.



#### <a name="stakeholders"></a> 2. Identify success-relevant stakeholders

<img src="/images/main-puzzle.jpg" class="picture-in-text show-for-medium-up">

We focus on stakeholders that are the most motivated to address waste management challenges and that are in the strongest position to facilitate a systemic change.
The success-relevant stakeholders we've identified so far include:
* **funders** - IGOs, development banks, governments of high-income countries, etc.;
* **problem owners** - national and local governments in low and middle income countries, companies, etc.;
* **methods leaders** - research centres, companies that design and build infrastructure, etc.;
* **capacity developers** - waste management companies, local governments, startups and startup accelerators, etc.;
* **new stakeholders** - organisations, both new ones and existing ones with new priorities, that are joining the waste management space due to the scale of the problem and the lack of progress in the past decade.

Beyond just identifying the success-relevant stakeholders, we are working towards gaining clarity on the dynamics and patterns that govern the landscape of the waste management space. 
This includes mapping global, regional and national funding flows, and mapping decision making capacity within each country.


#### <a name="coordination"></a> 3. Work with them 

<img src="/images/main-global.jpg" class="picture-in-text show-for-medium-up">

We work with success-relevant stakeholders to facilitate internal changes and enable powerful **coordination** between them. 
That means working on changing system dynamics and creating new systems, processes, relationships and tools, because existing organisational and funding structures do not support powerful coordination between stakeholders. 
We focus on the capacities of each stakeholder (financial and human capital, expertise, decision making power, etc.) instead of focusing on consensus. 
To prevent different efforts from cancelling each other out, we develop synergies between them, making them complementary instead of contradictory.
Thus we enable the stakeholders to amplify each other's positive impact, even if they don't agree with each other. 
We focus on identifying and addressing gaps, duplications and conflicts that impede systemic change on a global level.

Currently the connection between the **global vision** and each stakeholder's actions is inadequate. 
We are working to facilitate the development of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail, and to enable its implementation, starting with defining roles of different stakeholders. 
This requires moving from silos to a shared reality, and subsequently towards understanding of shared possibilities. 
We aim to do this without superimposing our values and ideas on stakeholders, by instead developing a shared multi-sided value proposition that addresses each stakeholder's individual motivations.

We are working to ensure that all stakeholders have **access to technical, financial and business expertise**. 
Thus we enable technical conversations at high level meetings (that usually focus on bold commitments without an actionable plan to achieve them) and facilitate better decisions. 
This includes identifying organisations/individuals with relevant expertise in technologies, engineering, chemistry, policy, finance, and innovative business models and financial instruments (for example ones that blend different types of funding or leverage partnerships). 
We are working with them to facilitate the transfer of technical knowledge (between countries, waste streams and different types of stakeholders) through a virtual centre for technical expertise or otherwise. 

All of this is a work in progress. 
We are resolved to keep an open mind, to keep experimenting with innovative ideas and to keep evolving our approach as we learn more about what is required to address the challenge.

Focus on building financially, socially and politically sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure.

What we don't do: circular economy, reduction, awareness, behavioural change of consumers. Not just plastic waste. List waste types
independent from politics

Working on future waste streams:
Currently plastic is getting most of the attention, as a relatively new type of waste that many countries are having problems dealing with.
Other new types of waste - electronics, batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, demolition waste - will soon become prevalent.
It is important to be prepared.

Our focus is on the waste generated today and in the next 10 years.
This is complementary to the [circular economy](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview) efforts that focus mostly on building a waste-free future. 

Our Sucess Metrics
the important ones are not quantifyable, but numerical ones are as follows - 3 of them
Identify systemic KPIs (key performance indicators) - what measure will show that pieces fit together.

**We focus on structural change.** - there are no checkboxes, progress bars for that
According to [Donella Meadows](https://donellameadows.org/) 99% of sustainability efforts are focussed on [parameter changes](https://hbr.org/2021/05/overselling-sustainability-reporting), which lack leverage and are rarely a source of real impact.
In waste management in particular, efforts often form a patchwork.
Our work will contribute to implementing structural change necessary to create holistic, financially, socially and politically sustainable waste management systems.



**Samudra will facilitate the development and implementation of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail** and ensure that the strategy keeps evolving along with changing circumstances, instead of becoming outdated.

We are not baking Samudra into solution.
Samudra's goal is solely to create [large systems change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29655206-change-for-the-audacious).

Once this is achieved, the organisation will dissolve.

Focus on visible problems and sexy solutions. Plastic waste is getting all the attention, largely due to the fact that it floats in water. While plastic pollution is truly a major challenge, singling out plastic often prevents the development of holistic, financially sustainable waste management systems. Efforts like the Ministerial Conference on Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution in 2021 encourage governments to focus only on a fraction of the whole waste management challenge, thus drastically limiting the potential of successful solutions.

Often the focus is on short-term solutions (like plastic credits) and technology-enabled solutions (usually mobile apps), not on building financially, socially and politically sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure.

The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools. Samudra will facilitate the development and implementation of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail and ensure that the strategy keeps evolving along with changing circumstances, instead of becoming outdated. Samudra will have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.

#### 2. Identify success-relevant stakeholders

Global and multi-level…local, regional, global

clarity on dynamics and patterns. that govern WM landscape

Stakeholders
business-government-civil society

Our Value Preposition
Multi-sided value proposition? It is a shared value proposition, but translated differently for each type of stakeholder.
Not super-imposing our ideas/values on other stakeholders


The scale of global waste management challenges and the lack of progress to date has led to an increase in the number of waste management stakeholders.
Apart from direct collaborations, there is no coordination between stakeholders, which results in efforts that cancel each other out instead of being complementary.
The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools.

funders (e.g. IGOs, development banks), problem-owners (e.g. national and city governments, companies), methods leaders (e.g. research centres, companies that design and build infrastructure), capacity developers (e.g. waste management companies, NGOs) and other stakeholders.
(national and local governments, companies big and small, funders, IGOs, NGOs, universities, etc.)


Facilitating technical knowledge flow

Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure will allow us to put important technical conversations (about technologies, infrastructure and financial instruments) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments without an actionable plan to achieve them.
Fostering transfer of technical knowledge between countries, waste streams, different types of stakeholders, and academia will ensure that better decisions are made.

Facilitating funding flow

Being creative when developing new financial instruments and new business models (like the ones that blend different types of funding or leverage partnerships) will allow us to build financially sustainable waste management systems.
The circular economy is currently the most innovative field in terms of new business models; we are planning to engage people from that field to help us solve waste management challenges.

They work with funders (governments of rich countries), problem-owners (governments of poor countries) and methods leaders (vaccine producers).

Over the past decade the amount of funding and talent dedicated to addressing waste management challenges has been steadily increasing, yet little progress has been made. Having researched the space for more than two years, we identified three main reasons for this.

Many efforts cancel each other out. The scale of global waste management challenges and the lack of progress to date has led to an increase in the number of waste management stakeholders.

startup accelerators - Enabling startups to address global challenges
While our main focus is on major stakeholders, we recognise that startups often create impact, new business models and innovation. Providing small amounts of initial funding to a large number of promising startups in the waste management space, especially focussing on the ones created by local people in low income countries, will allow us to explore the solution space most efficiently.

<!-- developing new tools, processes and relationships

we work on creating new systems, not criticizing old ones. Work on system dynamics, system transformation.

Systemic change not incremental

Moving from silos to shared reality.

roles of different stakeholders need to be defined

global orchestrator aligning activities 


conduct ecosystem leadership dialogs and ecosystem champions conferences. Get somebody to say yes, so that everyone says yes. 

Large scale change requires weaving together relationships in new ways.
It requires working with a much greater depth of collaboration than is supported by our current organisational and funding structures.

**Samudra will develop and support peer-like relationships among** fsuccess-relevant stakeholders
It is important to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders who usually don’t interact or whose interaction is typically one-sided.
We will focus on stakeholders that are the most motivated to overcome waste management challenges and that are in the strongest position to implement changes on a global level.
Instead of requiring unanimous agreement from all stakeholders (a requirement that as we've seen holds back the UN climate process), we will create groups of stakeholders that develop their own vision of the future and a plan for how to make it real.

Often stakeholder impact is limited not by the lack of funding or talent, but by each other - their many efforts cancel each other out. Our mission is to increase everyone's positive impact by aligning these efforts instead.


Samudra will have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.

**Samudra will act as a global orchestrator to develop synergies between different efforts** (especially those that don't agree with each other), making them complementary instead of contradictory. Such a stewardship organisation is necessary to amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders and to identify and address gaps, duplications and conflicts that impede the change on a global level.

Making these approaches complementary instead of contradictory will ensure that different stakeholders can increase each other's positive impact, even if they don't agree with each other.

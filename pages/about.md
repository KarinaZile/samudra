Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
Here we describe what we do, why we do it, and how our work directly contributes to 15 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) set by the UN.

<h4>Waste collection services for everyone</h4>
<br/>
Currently only 2 in 3 people worldwide have access to waste collection services. 
Every day 2.6 billion people face a choice of what to do with their waste. 
Some set it on fire, some add it to a dumpsite nearby, some drive long distances to dump it far away from home, some let currents in a nearby river to carry their waste away. 
<b>Ask yourself, what would you do if all the waste in your bin would be yours to keep?</b> 
At Samudra our goal is to minimise the number of people who have to make this choice. 



<h4>Back to front business of waste management</h4>
<br/>
Think of a successful company that sells a great product. 
How did they achieve that? 
They most likely started with identifying a market niche and learning about the target market segment. 
Then they made decisions about investment in appropriate infrastructure. 
Finally, they identified suppliers that can provide the type and amount of materials required for production. 
If you've ever started a company, you know that none of these steps are easy. 
Now imagine how hard it is to build a successful company if you must follow these steps in reverse order! 
In waste management you don't choose the composition or the amount of generated waste; everything that is produced in your collection area has to be processed. 
You then need to find a market for recyclable materials or products you can make with them yourself, but you cannot guarantee to your customers that you will be able to supply these continuously.
Often the waste composition changes faster than infrastructure investment pays off. 
As a result, waste management that doesn't harm the environment or human health is often not profitable. 
At Samudra we are motivated by solving problems, not by profit. 
That is why we decided to tackle global waste management challenges. 









<h4>Maximum impact projects</h4>
<br/>
<!--
What we do...
A lot of "misplaced" effort
80% of the plastic pollution comes from land and more than half of that comes from South-east Asia
About 80% of plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans originates on land, a lot of it is due to the lack of waste collection services in populated areas. This brings us to Indonesia, where about 10% of global marine plastic pollution originate. Currently only 32% of municipal solid waste is collected in Indonesia. Hence our initial goal - to improve coverage and efficiency of the waste collection system.
As our first challenge we picked marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter.

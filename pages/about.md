Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. Currently only 2 in 3 people worldwide have access to waste collection services. Ask yourself, what would you do if all of the waste in your bin would be your's to keep?

<h4>Back to front business of waste management</h4>
<br/>
Why we do it..
As our first challenge we picked marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 


<h4>Maximum impact projects</h4>
<br/>
What we do...
A lot of "misplaced" effort
80% of the plastic pollution comes from land and more than half of that comes from South-east Asia
About 80% of plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans originates on land, a lot of it is due to the lack of waste collection services in populated areas. This brings us to Indonesia, where about 10% of global marine plastic pollution originate. Currently only 32% of municipal solid waste is collected in Indonesia. Hence our initial goal - to improve coverage and efficiency of the waste collection system.


<h4>Best is the enemy of better</h4>
<br/>
Our approach...
Not perfect, just better



<h4>Evidence weights more than believes</h4>
<br/>
In depth research guides everything we do.


<h4>Zero-blame game</h4>
<br/>
It's not a zero-sum game...

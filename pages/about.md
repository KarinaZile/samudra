#### 1. Define success

For us success means **financially, politically and socially sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure** in every country. 
We focus on low and middle income countries where such systems and infrastructure are lacking. 
We focus on waste generated today and in the next 10 years. 
Hence our work is complementary to circular economy efforts aimed at building a waste-free future. 

For us success means holistic waste management systems that ensure that **all waste is collected** and that **materials and energy contained within waste are captured in the best possible way**. 
We focus on:
* biowaste - due to its large impact on climate and its potential to contribute to soil health and productivity;
* plastics - because it is a relatively new type of waste and it presents unique challenges and opportunities for recycling (not because it floats in water and looks dramatic in photos);
* e-waste, textiles, vehicles, tyres, demolition and disaster waste, etc. - types of waste that are rapidly becoming more prevalent;
* batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, etc. - types of waste associated with ongoing energy transition;
* medical waste - due to its impact on health (if dumped) and climate (if openly burnt);
* CO2, methane, etc. - we are exploring whether it would be useful to think of GHGs as waste;
* and all other types of waste (apart from radioactive waste).

<!-- For us success means...

To achive success we need to Facilitating technical knowledge flow AND Facilitating funding flow

Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure will allow us to put important technical conversations (about technologies, infrastructure and financial instruments) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments without an actionable plan to achieve them.
Fostering transfer of technical knowledge between countries, waste streams, different types of stakeholders, and academia will ensure that better decisions are made.

Developing innovative business ideas and financial instruments
Being creative when developing new financial instruments and new business models (like the ones that blend different types of funding or leverage partnerships) will allow us to build financially sustainable waste management systems. 
The circular economy is currently the most innovative field in terms of new business models; we are planning to engage people from that field to help us solve waste management challenges.


The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools. 
Samudra will facilitate the development and implementation of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail and ensure that the strategy keeps evolving along with changing circumstances, instead of becoming outdated. 
Samudra will have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.

Also success, but we don't do it:
circular economy, reduction, awareness, behavioural change of consumers.

Our Sucess Metrics
3 numerical ones
contribution to 15 SDGS (link to SDG page)
the important ones are not quantifyable

We focus on structural change. - Systemic change not incremental - there are no checkboxes, progress bars for that
Our work will contribute to implementing structural change 
According to [Donella Meadows](https://donellameadows.org/) 99% of sustainability efforts are focussed on [parameter changes](https://hbr.org/2021/05/overselling-sustainability-reporting), which lack leverage and are rarely a source of real impact.
Identify systemic KPIs (key performance indicators) - what measure will show that pieces fit together. 

We are not baking Samudra into solution.
Samudraâ€™s goal is solely to create large systems change. Once this is achieved, the organisation will dissolve. NOT to be a successful organisation.
Samudra's goal is solely to create/facilitate large systems change in the waste management sector. 
Once this is achieved, the organisation will dissolve. Or move on to a different sector.

#### 2. Identify success-relevant stakeholders

<p style="color:#AEAEAE">More details coming shortly.</p>

<!-- Stakeholders
local, regional, global

funders (e.g. IGOs, development banks, governments of high-income countries), 
problem-owners (e.g. national and local governments, companies), 
methods leaders (e.g. research centres, companies that design and build infrastructure), 
capacity developers (e.g. waste management companies, NGOs, startups) 
and other stakeholders.

We will focus on stakeholders that are the most motivated to overcome waste management challenges and that are in the strongest position to implement changes on a global level.

NEW The scale of global waste management challenges and the lack of progress to date has led to an increase in the number of waste management stakeholders. startups, new orgs, old orgs with new agendas
Over the past decade the amount of funding and talent dedicated to addressing waste management challenges has been steadily increasing,

To achive success we need to Facilitating technical knowledge flow AND Facilitating funding flow

startup accelerators - Enabling startups to address global challenges
While our main focus is on major stakeholders, we recognise that startups often create impact, new business models and innovation. Providing small amounts of initial funding to a large number of promising startups in the waste management space, especially focussing on the ones created by local people in low income countries, will allow us to explore the solution space most efficiently.

#### 3. Work with them

<!-- Work with success-relevant stakeholders to facilitate internal changes and enable powerful coordination between them.
more powerful coordination than is supported by our current organisational and funding structures
Samudra will develop and support peer-like relationships among success-relevant stakeholders

work on developing/creating new systems, processes and relationships and tools
Work on system dynamics, system transformation.

Moving from silos to shared reality. - towards understanding of shared possibilities
clarity on dynamics and patterns that govern WM landscape
roles of different stakeholders need to be defined
global orchestrator aligning activities
Samudra will act as a global orchestrator to develop synergies between different efforts (especially those that don't agree with each other), making them complementary instead of contradictory. 
Often stakeholder impact is limited not by the lack of funding or talent, but by each other - their many efforts cancel each other out. Our mission is to increase everyone's positive impact by aligning these efforts instead.
Many efforts cancel each other out. 
Apart from direct collaborations, there is no coordination between stakeholders, which results in efforts that cancel each other out instead of being complementary. 

Such a stewardship organisation is necessary to amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders and to identify and address gaps, duplications and conflicts that impede the change on a global level.
Making these approaches complementary instead of contradictory will ensure that different stakeholders can increase each other's positive impact, even if they don't agree with each other.

Our Value Preposition
Multi-sided value proposition? It is a shared value proposition, but translated differently for each type of stakeholder.
Not super-imposing our ideas/values on other stakeholders
Instead of requiring unanimous agreement from all stakeholders (a requirement that as we've seen holds back the UN climate process), we will create groups of stakeholders that develop their own vision of the future and a plan for how to make it real.


Facilitating technical knowledge flow AND Facilitating funding flow
Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure will allow us to put important technical conversations (about technologies, infrastructure and financial instruments) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments without an actionable plan to achieve them.
Fostering transfer of technical knowledge between countries, waste streams, different types of stakeholders, and academia will ensure that better decisions are made.



This work will lead to identifying more success-relevant stakeholders and working together to re-define success.

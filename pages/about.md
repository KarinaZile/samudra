Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
Here we describe what we do and why we do it, how we are different from other initiatives with similar goals, and how our work directly contributes to 15 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN. 
<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />



<h4>Waste collection services for everyone</h4>
<br/>
Currently only 2 in 3 people worldwide have access to waste collection services. 
Every day 2.6 billion people face a choice of what to do with their waste. 
Some set it on fire, some add it to a dumpsite nearby, some drive long distances to dump it far away from home, some let the current of a nearby river carry their waste away. 
<b>Ask yourself, what would you do if all the waste in your bin was yours to keep?</b> 
At Samudra our goal is to minimise the number of people who have to make this choice. 



<h4>Back to front business of waste management</h4>
<br/>
Think of a successful company that sells a great product. 
How did they achieve that? 
They most likely started with identifying a market niche and learning about the target market segment. 
Then they made decisions about investment in appropriate infrastructure. 
Finally, they identified suppliers that can reliably provide sufficient amounts of the right types of materials required for production. 
If you've ever started a company, you know that none of these steps are easy. 
Now imagine how hard it is to build a successful company if you must follow these steps in reverse order! 
In waste management you don't choose the composition or the amount of generated waste; everything that is produced in your collection area has to be processed. 
You then need to find a market for recyclable materials or products you can make with them yourself, but you cannot guarantee to your customers that you will be able to supply these continuously. 
Often the waste composition changes faster than the infrastructure investment pays off. 
As a result, waste management that doesn't harm the environment or human health is often not profitable. 
At Samudra we are motivated by solving problems, not by profit. 
That is why we decided to tackle global waste management challenges. 



<h4>Maximum impact projects</h4>
<br/>
Since we are not bound by trying to maximise our profit, we are free to work on projects with the highest potential impact. 
As our first challenge we picked marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 
It is <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768">estimated</a> that annually 6 to 16 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in our oceans, and the amount is growing every year. 
About 40% of this plastic pollution originates on land in Southeast Asia, additional 40% comes from other regions and the remaining 20% originates offshore, mainly from fishing, shipping and oil industries. 
It is hard to estimate the amount of plastic already present in our oceans, especially because only 3% of it is floating on the surface. 
One thing is clear - we can prevent more plastic pollution than we could eliminate by collecting the plastic that is already in our oceans. 
Hence our goal is to improve waste collection and treatment systems in Southeast Asia, which has the potential to reduce the amount of annual plastic pollution by 40%. 



<h4>Evidence weights more than believes</h4>

<h4>Best is the enemy of better</h4>

Our approach...
Not perfect, just better

<h4>No blame culture</h4>

It's not a zero-sum game...
the truth is nobody wants dirty planet

<h4>Less waste is always better</h4>

<h4>Our contribution to 15 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h4>
<br/>
"1. No poverty." 
Plastic pollution has a detrimental effect on tourism and fishing industries. 
Reducing the amount of pollution entering our oceans will provide direct economic benefits for local communities that depend on these industries.

"2. Zero hunger." 
Marine plastic pollution puts rich nutrition sources (fish, seafood and algae) at risk and leads to food chain contamination. 
Reducing the amount of pollution entering our oceans will secure safe nutrition sources for the future.

"3. Good health and well-being." 
Uncollected waste is openly burnt (leading to adverse effects on air quality) or dumped (facilitating the spread of contagious disease and disease vectors). 
Improving the coverage of waste collection services will lead to better physical and mental health, and reduce the prevalence of contagious diseases.

"5. Gender equality." 
Women are responsible for waste management in most households and are hence more exposed to the harmful substances released during open burning of waste. 
Due to a higher proportion of body fat compared to men, they are also more likely to accumulate these harmful substances in larger quantities. 
Improving the coverage of waste collection services will reduce this inequality.

"6. Clean water and sanitation." 
Uncollected waste and products created during open burning of waste pollute sources of drinking water (both water-bodies and ground waters). 
Improving the coverage of waste collection services will alleviate shortage of water for personal and agricultural use. 

"7. Affordable and clean energy." 
Even waste that is neither recyclable nor compostable has calorific value. 
Non-recyclable plastic can be chemically converted into fuel. 
Using waste as an energy resource will facilitate the shift away from more polluting fuels and produce affordable energy while reducing the environmental pollution at the same time.

"8. Decent work and economic growth." 
Millions of people make a living by participating in the informal waste management sector. 
They work without protective equipment and they often don't have access to healthcare. 
Many of them don't have IDs and none of them have a stable income. 
Creating waste management jobs for these people will result in better work conditions, more stable income, access to healthcare, further education and social safety net. 

"9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure."
The supply of raw materials is finite. 
Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will increase availability of raw (recycled) materials and affordable energy for local industries. 

"10. Reduced inequalities." 
Income inequality is exacerbated by the availability of waste collection services - low-income communities live in polluted environments and are exposed to harmful substances released during open burning of waste. 
Improving the coverage of waste collection services will reduce this health inequality and facilitate the economic growth of low-income communities. 

"11. Sustainable cities and communities." 
Uncollected waste results in air pollution from open burning of waste, spread of infectious diseases and floods caused by clogged drainage systems. 
Improving the coverage of waste collection services will facilitate sustainable development of urban and rural communities. 

"12. Responsible production and consumption." 
It is impossible to be a responsible producer or consumer if waste management services are not available. 
Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will facilitate the shift towards responsible product design and better waste management practices both in industry and in households. 

"13. Climate action." 
Landfills without methane capture infrastructure contribute a considerable amount to greenhouse gas emissions, as does the open burning of waste. 
Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will reduce the amount of emissions associated with waste. 

"14. Life below water." 
Ocean pollution is detrimental to marine ecosystem health. 
It harms all species in marine habitats and the food chains they belong to. 
Reducing the amount of pollution entering our oceans will be an essential part of preventing marine ecosystem collapse. 

"15. Life on land."
Waste washed up on the shores, leachate from dumped waste and ashes from open burning of waste pollute our land. 
As landfills fill up, need for new ones often results in deforestation of surrounding areas. 
Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will reduce deforestation and environmental contamination, as well as protect biodiversity and fertility of our land. 

"17. Partnerships for the goals."
Concerns about urgent waste management challenges that need to be addressed often result in blaming companies, consumers or governments. 
This leads to a counterproductive divide between "us" and "them". 
Creating collaborative solutions that allow everyone to participate will result in better outcomes for people and our planet.

Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
Here we describe what we do and why we do it, how we are different from other initiatives with similar goals, and how our work directly contributes to 15 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN.

<h4>Waste collection services for everyone</h4>
<br/>
Currently only 2 in 3 people worldwide have access to waste collection services. 
Every day 2.6 billion people face a choice of what to do with their waste. 
Some set it on fire, some add it to a dumpsite nearby, some drive long distances to dump it far away from home, some let the current of a nearby river carry their waste away. 
<b>Ask yourself, what would you do if all the waste in your bin would be yours to keep?</b> 
At Samudra our goal is to minimise the number of people who have to make this choice. 



<h4>Back to front business of waste management</h4>
<br/>
Think of a successful company that sells a great product. 
How did they achieve that? 
They most likely started with identifying a market niche and learning about the target market segment. 
Then they made decisions about investment in appropriate infrastructure. 
Finally, they identified suppliers that can reliably provide sufficient amounts of the right types of materials required for production. 
If you've ever started a company, you know that none of these steps are easy. 
Now imagine how hard it is to build a successful company if you must follow these steps in reverse order! 
In waste management you don't choose the composition or the amount of generated waste; everything that is produced in your collection area has to be processed. 
You then need to find a market for recyclable materials or products you can make with them yourself, but you cannot guarantee to your customers that you will be able to supply these continuously. 
Often the waste composition changes faster than the infrastructure investment pays off. 
As a result, waste management that doesn't harm the environment or human health is often not profitable. 
At Samudra we are motivated by solving problems, not by profit. 
That is why we decided to tackle global waste management challenges. 



<h4>Maximum impact projects</h4>
<br/>
Since we are not bound by trying to maximise our profit, we are free to work on projects with the highest potential impact. 
As our first challenge we picked marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 
It is <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768">estimated</a> that annually 6 to 16 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in our oceans, and the amount is growing every year. 
About 40% of this plastic pollution originates on land in Southeast Asia, additional 40% comes from other regions and the remaining 20% originates offshore, mainly from fishing, shipping and oil industries. 
It is hard to estimate the amount of plastic already present in our oceans, especially because only 3% of it is floating on the surface. 
One thing is clear - we can prevent more plastic pollution than we could eliminate by collecting the plastic that is already in our oceans. 
Hence our goal is to improve waste collection and treatment systems in Southeast Asia, which has the potential to reduce the amount of annual  ne plastic pollution by 40%.

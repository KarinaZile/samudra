### 1. What is Samudra? What does it do? 

Here is the [draft of the answer](https://samudra.world/test/). 
Please read it first before continuing, so that we are on the same page. 
I imagine the homepage will contain this text and not much more. 



### 2. Purpose of the website

I set a goal(s) for Samudra. 
I then reach out to organisations/people who can be or have to be involved in achieving the goal. 
Some of them check Samudra's website before deciding whether to reply to my message.
Hence the main purpose of Samudra's website is to reassure organisations/people who have to be involved in achieving the goal that they should reply to my message. 
By "have to be" I mean governments of the relevant country that have to issue permits and restructure their departments and funding pots, funders with a large enough amount of available funding that they can enable building large-scale infrastructure (in cases where there is only one such funder), etc. 
There are too many different types of organisations (governments, banks, companies, standard setters, community groups, NGOs, IGOs, academics and many more), so it's not possible to have neat buttons like [here](https://www.ministryofwaste.co/), where you are supposed to click on Government, Recyclers or Communities based on who you are.

Secondary purpose of the website is to act as a selection tool for organisations/people who can be involved in achieving the goal. 
People who would be interested in working with Samudra should get convinced by the website to reply to my message. 
People who have incompatibly different value systems and who would definitely not want to work with Samudra should get discouraged by the website. 

The minor purpose for the website is to give curious public an idea about what we are working on and how.
There is no call for action - if you just came across my website (without me messaging you first), there is nothing you can do to help or get involved, or anything. 
Of course, lucky accidents happen, and somebody might find my website before I found them, but they will immediately know they should message me...I think.



### 3. Technical specs of the website

I have no idea what the website should look like. 
What I do know is that many people whom I need to reach are still on Windows 96, many have only a smartphone, and many pay for data per megabyte.
So definitely no videos that play in the background [like here](https://www.khepra.io/), no fancy transitions [like text appearing from behind the mountain](https://www.unrulycap.com/).
Plain static website. 
Straight, serious, bold and convincing. 
Mobile first. 
Loads fast, using barely any data.



### 4. Ideas

Somebody once told me that from looking at a website for 2 seconds you can easily tell if it is a startup, a consultancy or a large corporation. 
Since then I've noticed that they are right. 
Samudra is a new type of organisation...so the website should feel like nothing you've seen before?

Despite the title of this section, I have no ideas.

One thing that I've seen and really liked: [this think tank](https://www.chathamhouse.org/) has a footer that says "Chatham House is a world-leading policy institute with a mission to ...", it says that on every page of the website. It reminds you of who they are every time you scroll to the bottom of any page. I think Samudra would benefit from copying this idea (I know the people, I'll tell them I stole their idea and that I'm grateful).

Current Samudra website is waste-themed. 
This theme has to be removed, or at least confined to the part of the website that talks about our goal in the waste management space. 
I don't know what a new theme could be.
Definitely not pictures of crying babies in landfills - we are not a charity. 
Definitely not something like [this](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/search?k=%22network+background%22) that screams AI, digital future, big data, globally scalable, etc.
What then? 
No photos, no graphics of systems...and what we do is build systems.
I'm totally stuck.


### 5. Content

Current content of the website (apart from the homepage) includes [waste-specific resources](https://samudra.world/resources/), more information about Samudra [here](https://samudra.world/about/) and an attempt to update the visitor on our [progress](https://samudra.world/our-work/). 
Waste-specific resources will probably be confined to the part of the website that talks about our goal in the waste management space. 
Everything else has to be replaced. 

An initial (bad) idea I had was to include a map of the world that is coloured by the availability of waste management services. 
That would both show which countries (or sub-national regions) we are focussing on, and reassure the visitor that we have the data and we know what we are doing. 
Unfortunately that would not work - no Environment Minister will work with me if his country is coloured worse then the neighboring country. 
In some countries it is illegal to use "outsider data" (like from World Bank reports) and only data collected by local officials inside the country can be used when talking about the waste management situation. 
I don't want my website being illegal to be an obstacle. 

What I would like to show on the website is the metrics we use to choose which solutions are better and to measure our impact. 
These are climate impact (amount of emissions avoided, in CO2-equivalent tonnes), environmental impact (this one is more complicated...) and health impact (reduction in number of humans who are exposed to toxic environments, people don't have to get physically sick or die, reduction in cognitive ability and poor mental health also count).
This could probably be a whole page on its own - "How we measure our impact".

In the past years I worked directly with an Environment Minister of an African country (the only condition was that I won't be able to disclose which country or what we worked on), I did a big project in Asia for a large IGO (the only condition was that I was ghost-writing under an influential name and that's how I made an impact, again by officially not existing), etc.
My approach is to produce solutions, road-maps and ideas in a way that other organisations/egos get credit for it. 
It works brilliantly. 
The only problem - it doesn't generate any content for the website. 
How do I make a website that tells you nothing but makes you feel like we are doing something?
And that you should reply to my message?

**2022:** Our goals for this year are to identify main success-relevant stakeholders and their capacities, and to explore the possibilities that result from adopting systems incubator as our organisational structure.

**2021:** During 2021 we worked with national governments, city governments, waste management companies, startups in waste management space and other types of stakeholders to understand the landscape of the waste management sector from their different perspectives. 

**2020:** We used 2020 to explore waste management systems in low and middle income countries; technologies for recycling, waste collection, treatment and disposal; relevant funding mechanisms and policy frameworks. That equipped us with a deep understanding of what are the causes of the problem we are trying to solve.

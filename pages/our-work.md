<span class="larger-word">2022:</span> Our goals for this year are to identify main success-relevant stakeholders and their capacities, and to explore the possibilities that result from adopting systems incubator as our organisational structure.

<span class="larger-word">2021:</span> During 2021 we worked with national governments, city governments, waste management companies and startups, and other types of stakeholders to understand the landscape of the waste management sector from their different perspectives. This understanding of how capacities, motivations and limitations (political, financial and cultural) differ between stakeholders gives us a competitive edge.

This understanding also reinforced our belief that no stakeholders are to blame. Contributions to solving waste management challenges from every stakeholder are truly appreciated by us, not merely expected.

<span class="larger-word">2020:</span> We used 2020 to explore waste management systems in low and middle income countries, funding mechanisms and policy frameworks. That equipped us with a deep understanding of what are the causes of the problem we are trying to solve. 

We also explored technologies for waste collection, treatment, sorting, recycling and disposal. We learnt that there are no turnkey solutions and no "best" technologies, everything depends on the context - characteristics and volumes of waste, environmental and geological conditions, climate, culture, political situation and economic conditions.

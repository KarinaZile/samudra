<h5>1. Nigeria 206m - CANEI works here a bit</h5>

The price of raw unsorted PET waste (buying directly from waste pickers) has more than doubled in the past 12 months.
There are a lot of Chinese buyers coming in, so CANEI would have to offer good prices to compete with them.

**In Abuja:** [Olufunto Boroffice][25] [funtob@chanjadatti.com][26] CEO of [Chanja Datti Recycling][27] and vice-president of [Recyclers Association of Nigeria (RAN)][28]

The best person I've met so far.
They are looking to start exporting by the end of April (they are currently in the middle of a move to a new location). 
They normally have 150-200 tonnes of PET per month to sell. 
Their bales are 500-600kg, so they say they can do 20-21 tonnes per container.
They would like to send a test bale to CANEI.

Olufunto said we should have a meeting with [Mazi Ukonu][29], president of [Recyclers Association of Nigeria (RAN)][28] and founder of [RecyclePoints][30].
Would you be able to join this meeting with Olufunto Boroffice and Mazi Ukonu? 
If yes, let me know a couple of slots when you are available and I'll organise.

**In Ibadan:** Yinka from Deepcyclers [deepcyclers@gmail.com][12]

They have 15 tonnes per month to sell (15 sorterting staff make 1 tonne each per month) of clear PET. 
They have 1 single baler and 1 double baler. 
They can make 200kg bales, but often they make 100kg bales for easier manual handling. 
They are selling at 250,000 - 300,000 naira per tonne (in Ibadan) or 300,000 - 350,000 naira per tonne (if they deliver to Lagos). 
To scale their business they need more physical space, more sorting staff and more waste pickers who will collect PET waste for them. 
Other PET handling companies in Ibadan already have buyers to whom they are loyal, they are not looking for new buyers. 
Deepcyclers is a new company that is just starting, so they are looking for buyers.

Are you interested in engaging with Deepcyclers?


<h5 style="color:#979797;">2. Ethiopia 115m - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5 style="color:#979797;">3. Egypt 102m</h5>
<span style="color: #979797">There is a legislation that prevents export of baled bottles or flakes, only recycled pellets can be exported.</span>


<h5>4. DRC 90m</h5>
A local told me that "amount of PET bottles in DRC is probably small given most drinks are still in glass bottles".

[Jimmy Hamuli][20] [jimmy_hamuli@ymail.com][21] (mentioned in this [article][22]) told me he has set up a social economy initiative specializing in the collection and processing of household waste, and that there are many other initiatives that collect PET bottles, including Kinpeto. 
He doesn't speak English; should I put him in touch with your French-speaking colleague over email?

<h5 style="color:#979797;">5. Tanzania 60 - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5>6. South Africa 59m - CANEI works here a bit</h5>

Please speak to Cheri Scholtz [cherischoltz@mweb.co.za][7], CEO of [PETCO][1] - South Africa’s PET plastic producer responsibility organisation (PRO). 

<h5 style="color:#979797;">7. Kenya 54m - CANEI already works here</h5>

[Takataka Solutions][31] - are you already working with them? If not I'll reach out to them.


<h5 style="color:#979797;">8. Uganda 46m - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5>9. Algeria 44m</h5>

[350,000 tons of PET][6] imported into Algeria annually, and only 5% is recycled.

Merzouk Abdelwafi, CEO of SARL Toptek, is THE person to speak to (as described [here][17]), but he doesn't speak English and I can't find his contact details. 
I've reached out to [Chloé Schwizgebel][18] and [Marwane Tahayassine][19] for help, but neither of them is replying.

I spoke to a person from [Global Environment Facility (GEF)][11] who evaluates waste management projects in Algeria and decides whether GEF will fund them; to my surprise and disappointment they knew nothing about the waste management situation in Algeria.

I've contacted Youb Okkacha [okachayoub@yahoo.fr][15] (the author of this [paper][16]).
He doesn't speak English; should I put him in touch with your French-speaking colleague over email?


<h5>10. Sudan 44m</h5>

I spoke to Aisha Magzoub who just got a new job and so no longer works in waste management. 
She promised to introduce me to her friend in the Environment Ministry, who will share the information about PET collectors.

<h5>11. Morocco 37m</h5>
<h5>12. Angola 33m</h5>
<h5>13. Mozambique 31m</h5>
<h5>14. Ghana 31m</h5>

Prices for PET waste are increasing rapidly, partly due to the EU minimum recycled content regulations and due to the textile industry competing for feedstock. 
In Ghana, generally, there are more buyers (international) of PET waste than there is supply. 
The market is not transparent, due to the "negative competition" - different waste aggregators don't just push each other to perform better than others, they actively sabotage each other's efforts.

I spoke to [Jeff Provencal][10] [jeffrey@repatrn.com][9], founder of rePATRN. 
They do 400 tonnes of baled PET per month. 
Their density is 15 tonnes per container (they reckon it's more than others can do). 
rePATRN has no shortage of buyers, but they would be interested in creating recycling capacity in Ghana, for example a local bottle-to-bottle PET recycling facilities. 
Is that of interest to CANEI?

[Florent Kossivi Tiassou][23] [tiassou@yahoo.fr][24] (lives in Germany, but from Togo originally) organises regular PET waste collection events for local people in Togo. 
He is wondering if you'd be interested in buying 50 tonnes from him every second month instead of every month? 
He'll be in Togo during the first week of April, I can ask him to put me in touch with other PET collectors then.

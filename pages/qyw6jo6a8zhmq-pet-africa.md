<h5>1. Nigeria 206m - CANEI works here a bit</h5>

The price of raw unsorted PET waste (buying directly from waste pickers) has more than doubled in the past 12 months.
There are a lot of Chinese buyers coming in, so CANEI would have to offer good prices to compete with them.

Contacts handed over to Ahraby:
1. In Abuja: [Olufunto Boroffice][25] [funtob@chanjadatti.com][26] CEO of [Chanja Datti Recycling][27] and vice-president of [Recyclers Association of Nigeria (RAN)][28].
	They are looking to start exporting by the end of April (they are currently in the middle of a move to a new location). 
	They normally have 150-200 tonnes of PET per month to sell. 
	Their bales are 500-600kg, so they say they can do 20-21 tonnes per container.

2. In Lagos: [Mazi Ukonu][29] [alisonukonu@gmail.com][31] founder of [RecyclePoints][30] and president of [Recyclers Association of Nigeria (RAN)][28].

3. In Ibadan: Yinka Adeniyi [deepcyclers@gmail.com][12] founder of Deepcyclers.
	They have 15 tonnes per month to sell (15 sorterting staff make 1 tonne each per month) of clear PET. 
	They have 1 single baler and 1 double baler. 
	They can make 200kg bales, but often they make 100kg bales for easier manual handling. 
	To scale their business they need more physical space, more sorting staff and more waste pickers who will collect PET waste for them. 





<h5 style="color:#979797;">2. Ethiopia 115m - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5 style="color:#979797;">3. Egypt 102m</h5>
<span style="color: #979797">There is a legislation that prevents export of baled bottles or flakes, only recycled pellets can be exported.</span>


<h5>4. DRC 90m</h5>
A local told me that "amount of PET bottles in DRC is probably small given most drinks are still in glass bottles".

French (only) speaking contacts:
* [Jimmy Hamuli][20] [jimmy_hamuli@ymail.com][21] (mentioned in this [article][22]) told me he has set up a social economy initiative specializing in the collection and processing of household waste, and that there are many other initiatives that collect PET bottles, including Kinpeto. 


<h5 style="color:#979797;">5. Tanzania 60 - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5>6. South Africa 59m - CANEI works here a bit</h5>

Please speak to Cheri Scholtz [cherischoltz@mweb.co.za][7], CEO of [PETCO][1] - South Africa’s PET plastic producer responsibility organisation (PRO). 


<h5 style="color:#979797;">7. Kenya 54m - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5 style="color:#979797;">8. Uganda 46m - CANEI already works here</h5>

<h5>9. Algeria 44m</h5>

[350,000 tons of PET][6] imported into Algeria annually, and only 5% is recycled.

French (only) speaking contacts:
* Merzouk Abdelwafi, CEO of SARL Toptek, is THE person to speak to (as described [here][17]).
I can't find his contact details. 
I've reached out to [Chloé Schwizgebel][18] and [Marwane Tahayassine][19] for help, but neither of them is replying.
* Youb Okkacha [okachayoub@yahoo.fr][15] (the author of this [paper][16]). Replies to emails.

<h5>10. Sudan 44m</h5>

I spoke to Aisha Magzoub who just got a new job and so no longer works in waste management. 
She promised to introduce me to her friend in the Environment Ministry, who will share the information about PET collectors.
**The relevant person is on holiday until the 19th.**

<h5>11. Morocco 37m</h5>
<h5>12. Angola 33m</h5>
<h5>13. Mozambique 31m</h5>
<h5>14. Ghana 31m</h5>

Prices for PET waste are increasing rapidly, partly due to the EU minimum recycled content regulations and due to the textile industry competing for feedstock. 
In Ghana, generally, there are more buyers (international) of PET waste than there is supply. 
The market is not transparent, due to the "negative competition" - different waste aggregators don't just push each other to perform better than others, they actively sabotage each other's efforts.

I spoke to [Jeff Provencal][10] [jeffrey@repatrn.com][9], founder of rePATRN. 
They do 400 tonnes of baled PET per month. 
Their density is 15 tonnes per container (they reckon it's more than others can do). 
rePATRN has no shortage of buyers, but they would be interested in creating recycling capacity in Ghana, for example a local bottle-to-bottle PET recycling facilities. 
Both me and Ahraby agree that now is not the right time to talk to rePATRN.

[Naomi Fagla Medegan][13] [naomi@gbobeto.org][32], Director of [Gbobètô][14], is interested in working with CANEI.
They currently have one waste sorting site in Porto-Novo, where they have a lot of PET waste they've collected.
There they have a women led workforce. 
Naomi has hired a coach for them to train them how to work more efficiently, be on time, remember to wear gloves when touching waste, etc.
She is working directly with the national government to set up 14 more waste sorting sites across the country. 
She is in the process of buying a baler right now (probably from Morocco), so will be able to buy one that will ensure a good number of tonnes per container. 

<h5>30. Burundi 12m</h5>
<h5>31. Tunisia 12m</h5>
<h5>32. South Sudan 11m</h5>
<h5>33. Togo 8m</h5>

[Florent Kossivi Tiassou][23] [tiassou@yahoo.fr][24] (lives in Germany, but from Togo originally) organises regular PET waste collection events for local people in Togo. 
He says he would like to sell 50 tonnes of baled PET every second month, but I'm not sure if he knows how much 50 tonnes is.
He'll be in Togo during the first week of April, I will ask him to put me in touch with other PET collectors then.

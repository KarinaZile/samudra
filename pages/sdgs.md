  text: Plastic pollution has a detrimental effect on tourism, fishing and shipping industries. Reducing the amount of pollution entering our oceans will provide direct economic benefits for local communities that depend on these industries.

  text: Marine plastic pollution puts rich nutrition sources (fish, seafood and algae) at risk, and leads to food chain contamination. Reducing the amount of pollution entering our oceans will secure safe nutrition sources for the future.

  text: Uncollected waste is either openly burnt (leading to adverse effects on air quality) or dumped (facilitating the spread of disease vectors and contagious diseases). Improving the coverage of waste collection services will lead to better physical and mental health, and reduce the prevalence of contagious diseases.

  text: Women are responsible for waste management in most households and are hence more exposed to the harmful substances released during open burning of waste. Due to the higher proportion of body fat compared to men they are also more likely to accumulate these harmful substances in larger quantities. Improving the coverage of waste collection services will reduce this inequality.

  text: Leachate from uncollected waste and toxic emissions created during open burning of waste pollute sources of drinking water (both water-bodies and ground waters). Improving the coverage of waste collection services will ensure that more people have access to safe drinking water and that agricultural produce is not contaminated through water.

  text: Even waste that is neither recyclable nor compostable has calorific value; it can be converted into energy. Using waste as an energy resource will facilitate the shift away from more polluting fuels and produce affordable energy while reducing the environmental pollution at the same time.

  text: Millions of people make a living by participating in the informal waste management sector. Most of them work without protective equipment, have no access to healthcare, and occasionally face hunger due to irregular income. Our vision is to make the current waste pickers the last generation of waste pickers by creating opportunities for them and their children.

  text: The supply of raw materials is finite. Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will increase the availability of raw (recycled) materials and affordable energy in the form of electricity and heat for local industries.

  text: Income inequality is exacerbated by the availability of waste collection services. Low-income communities live in polluted environments and are exposed to toxic emissions released during open burning of waste. Improving the coverage of waste collection services will reduce this health inequality and facilitate the economic growth of low-income communities.

  text: Uncollected waste results in air pollution from open burning of waste, the spread of infectious diseases and floods caused by clogged drainage systems. Improving the coverage of waste collection services will facilitate the sustainable development of urban and rural communities.

  text: It is impossible to be a responsible producer or consumer if waste management services are not available. Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will facilitate the shift towards responsible product design and better waste management practices both in industry and in households.

  text: Landfills and dumpsites without methane capture infrastructure and open burning of waste result in considerable climate impact. Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will reduce climate impact associated with waste. Combining energy recovery with carbon capture technology can result in carbon negative waste disposal methods.

  text: Ocean pollution is detrimental to the health of marine ecosystems. It harms all marine species and all species that are part of the food chains they belong to. Reducing the amount of pollution entering our oceans will be an essential part of preventing marine ecosystem collapse.

  text: Leachate from uncollected waste and toxic emissions created during open burning of waste pollute our land. The need for more and more landfills, given the rate at which they fill up, often results in deforestation. Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will reduce environmental contamination and the rate of deforestation, as well as protect biodiversity and fertility of our land.

  text: Concerns about urgent waste management challenges often result in blaming companies, consumers or governments. This leads to a counterproductive divide between "us" and "them". Creating collaborative solutions will allow everyone to contribute towards a better outcome for us all. More can be achieved in a no blame culture in which everyoneâ€™s contribution is truly appreciated, not merely expected.

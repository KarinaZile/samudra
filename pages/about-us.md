The waste management sector accounts for 5-15% of human-made climate impact, and the sector's total negative impact on climate, environment and health is rapidly increasing. 
Our goal is to **increase municipal solid waste collection rates in low and middle income countries**, as currently 1 in 3 people globally have no access to waste collection services. 
To achieve this goal we are building a **global action network** - a new type of organisation, that is neither government, nor business, nor civil society, but a structure that combines the resources and competences of all of these.



### What is the problem 

Currently about 25% of all municipal solid waste (MSW) is not collected - more than 500 million tonnes per year.
The amount of MSW is increasing due to urbanisation, population growth and increasing purchasing power; this increase is especially rapid in regions where MSW collection rates are below 50%.
Both uncollected and mismanaged waste have a detrimental impact on
* **climate** - greenhouse gas (GHG) and black carbon emissions from organic waste and open burning of waste, damaging natural GHG sinks (oceans, soils and plants). <!-- , read more here. -->
* **environment** - waste polluting the oceans, leachate from waste, toxic emissions from open burning of waste, wastewater from unregulated recycling activities. <!-- , read more here. -->
* **health** - air pollution, food contaminated with nanoplastics and heavy metals, polluted drinking water, mosquitoes breading in uncollected waste. <!-- , read more here. -->

Despite these detrimental impacts, waste management remains relatively neglected compared to other areas of climate action, global development and sustainability. 

According to UNEP (2015, p.12), [10-15% reduction in global GHG emissions could be achieved][1] through improvements to solid waste management systems - dumpsite closure, waste diversion from landfills, energy from waste, recycling, etc. (not including waste prevention).
According to the World Bank (2018, p.115), even basic improvements to solid waste management systems can [reduce the emissions associated with waste by at least 25%][2].
Despite this potential for limiting climate change, waste management is barely mentioned in IPCC Assessment Reports and was not discussed at UN Climate Change Conferences until COP26 where it was featured in a side event.

Comparing the World Bank's reports from [2012][3] (p.15) and [2018][2] (p.32) shows little progress on waste management challenges.



### What is being done and why it doesn't work

Over the past decade the amount of funding and talent dedicated to addressing waste management challenges has been steadily increasing, yet little progress has been made. 
Having researched the space for more than two years, we identified 3 main reasons for this.

**Many efforts cancel each other out.** Given the scale of global waste management challenges and the lack of progress to date, many new stakeholders have joined existing ones. 
Apart from direct collaborations, there is no coordination between stakeholders, which results in efforts that cancel each other out instead of being complementary.
The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools.

**Reports, webinars and voluntary commitments.** Many efforts backed by a significant amount of funding and talent result in reports and events, which are useful if considered in isolation, but in the context of existing reports and previous events they don't get us any closer to overcoming waste management challenges. 

At COP26 nations agreed to "start a dialogue" on loss and damage resulting from climate change, but [a proposal to establish a new funding facility to help affected countries was unsuccessful][5]. 
At the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) the mood is set by the fact that [signatories failed to meet any of the targets they set for themselves][4] at the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010 (COP10).
It is difficult to be optimistic about the potential of the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution that is currently being developed.

**Focus on visible problems and sexy solutions.** Plastic waste is getting all the attention, largely due to the fact that it floats in water. 
While plastic pollution is truly a major challenge, singling out plastic often prevents c
Efforts like the [Ministerial Conference on Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution][6] in 2021 encourage governments to focus only on a fraction of the whole waste management challenge, thus drastically limiting the potential of successful solutions.

Often the focus is on short-term solutions (like plastic credits) and technology-enabled solutions (usually mobile apps), not on building financially, socially and politically sustainable waste management systems and infrastructure.



### What Samudra is planning to do

Let's change the way we approach change!
To **increase municipal solid waste collection rates in low and middle income countries** we are building Samudra - a **global action network**, a new type of organisation that is neither government, nor business, nor civil society, but a structure that combines resources and competences of all of these.
Our focus is on the waste generated today and in the next 10 years.
This is complementary to [circular economy][7] efforts that focus mostly on building a waste-free future. 

**Large scale change requires weaving together relationships in new ways.**
It requires working with a much greater depth of collaboration than is supported by our current organisational and funding structures.
Samudra will develop and support peer-like relationships among funders (e.g. IGOs, development banks), problem-owners (e.g. national and city governments, companies), methods leaders (e.g. research centres, companies that design and build infrastructure), capacity developers (e.g. waste management companies, NGOs) and other stakeholders.
It is important to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders that usually donâ€™t interact or whose interaction is typically one-sided.

We will focus on stakeholders that are the most motivated to overcome waste management challenges and that are in the strongest position to implement changes on a global level.
Instead of requiring a unanimous agreement of all stakeholders (which holds back UN climate process), we will create [coalitions of the willing][8] - groups of stakeholders that develop their own vision of the future and a plan how to get there.

**The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools.** 
Samudra will facilitate the development and implementation of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail. 
It will act as a global orchestrator to develop synergies between different efforts (making them complementary instead of contradictory), to deal with duplication and conflict, to amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders, and to identify and address the gaps that impede the change on a global level. 
It is important to embed complementarity into different efforts, especially those that don't agree with each other.

**An organisation with global reach and no inertia.**
In practical terms, Samudra will be a stewardship organisation that will allow the change to emerge, without attempting to manage the change.
It will have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.
It will facilitate the development of a global waste management strategy and ensure that the strategy keeps evolving along with changing circumstances, instead of becoming outdated. 
It will ensure focus on 15 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Samudra will be funded by impact-based grants. 
In terms of organisational structure, we envision something similar to [Tech Zero][9] - a core team working alongside employees of major stakeholders that have been dedicated to creating change by  weaving together relationships in new ways.



### Why we think it is going to work

**Waste management is an easy problem in many ways.**
Unlike GHG emissions that are hard to capture, waste is easy to collect; and it can be characterized without any specialised equipment.
Technologies for waste processing and disposal are mature, scalable and tested in a wide range of conditions.
Reducing GHG emissions requires tradeoffs, while an improved waste management system provides direct benefits to both the local area and the surrounding areas.

**Our focus is on building systems that work, not patchwork.**
Our work will contribute to implementing [structural change, not just parameter change][10].
Using our skills in mathematics and complex systems, we will facilitate development of holistic, financially, socially and politically sustainable waste management systems.

**We are learning from those who have succeeded.**
For example, to vaccinate children in low income countries against deadly and debilitating infectious diseases, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance was created.
They work with funders (governments of rich countries), problem-owners (governments of poor countries) and methods leaders (vaccine producers).
To date they've helped vaccinate more than 880 million children.

**We understand the situation from the perspectives of different stakeholders.**
Over the past two years we've been working with national governments, city governments, waste management companies (both big ones and startups) and NGOs.
Different stakeholders have different capacities and goals, and they approach challenges in different ways.
Making these approaches complementary instead of contradictory will ensure that different stakeholders can increase each other's positive impact, even if they don't agree with each other.

**We have a no blame culture.**
We aim to engage as many different types of stakeholders as possible.
We understand that not every stakeholder has the desire and capacity to contribute to addressing global waste management challenges.
Those who do contribute can be sure that their contribution will be truly appreciated, not merely expected.

**We don't have a favourite waste disposal method.**
Every solution can be good or bad depending on the context; and every solution has an opportunity cost.
We assess all possible solutions based on their impact on climate, environment and health.
Our aim is not to strive for a perfect solution, but to improve the situation as soon as possible.



### Other ideas we are planning to work on

**Providing data to enable everyone to make data-driven decisions.**
Climate action, global development and overcoming waste management challenges is [not possible without data][11].
Over the past two years of working with waste related data, we've met 4 challenges:
* Data not available for free.
For example, [the review of plastic chemical recycling technologies][12] by Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, [the list of waste management infrastructure around the world][13] by AcuComm, and even [Global Plastics Outlook][14] by OECD.
* Sources of data are hard to find.
Often the reference provided is to a source that provides another reference, etc.
It takes a long time to find the original source, often hundreds of pages long, and to find the cited information within it.
* Data is outdated.
The amount of waste generated is growing rapidly and its composition is changing.
Outdated data is misleading and does not provide enough information to be able to predict future volumes and composition of waste.
* Most often the data simply doesn't exist.
This is particularly relevant when trying to show GHG emission reduction potential of a particular project.
If there is no data about waste, officially there are no emissions associated with waste, and hence any non-zero-emission project will increase total emissions on paper.

Making useful, up to date data (with transparent citations directly to original source) available for free will enable everyone to make data-driven decisions, regardless of their financial situation.
Examples of this being done in other contexts include [Right to Equitable and Professional Auto Industry Repair (REPAIR) Act][15] in the US and the [ESG Book][16] aimed at [disrupting sustainability sector with free data][17].



**Facilitating technical knowledge flow.**
Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure that will allow us to put important technical conversations (about technologies, infrastructure and financing instruments) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments lacking an actionable plan to achieve them.
Fostering transfers of technical knowledge between countries and from academia will ensure that better decisions are made.



**Working on future waste streams.**
Currently plastic is getting all the attention, as a relatively new type of waste that many countries are having problems dealing with.
New types of waste - electronics, batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, demolition waste - will soon become prevalent waste streams.
It is important to be prepared for these new waste streams.



**Developing innovative business ideas, financial instruments and concepts.**
Being creative when developing new financial instruments and new business models (perhaps ones that blend different types of funding or leverage partnerships) will allow us to build financially sustainable waste management systems.
Currently the most innovative field in terms of new business models is circular economy; we are planning to engage people from that field to help us solve waste management challenges.

Sometimes, all that is needed is just developing a new concept as [explained][18] by Rory Sutherland.
Borrowing the idea from David Peetz who coined the term [carbon productivity][19], what if we define "waste productivity" - the amount of value achieved by a certain amount of waste - to inform the decisions about what types of items or packaging should be banned.



**Enabling startups to address global challenges.**
While our main focus is on major stakeholders, we recognise that a lot of innovation, new business models and impact is created by startups.
Providing small amounts of initial funding to a large number of promising startups in waste management space, especially focussing on the ones created by local people in low income countries, will allow us to explore the solution space most efficiently.

Examples of this being done in another context include the partnership between International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Goldman Sachs in 2014, that created [the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility][20], which mobilized capital for local financial institutions to lend to women owned businesses.

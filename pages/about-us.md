The waste management sector accounts for 5-15% of human-made climate impact, and the sector's total negative impact on climate, environment and health is rapidly increasing. 
Our goal is to **increase municipal solid waste collection rates in low and middle income countries**, as currently 1 in 3 people globally have no access to waste collection services. 
To achieve this goal we are building a **global action network** - a new type of organisation, that is neither government, nor business, nor civil society, but a structure that combines the resources and competences of all of these.



### What is the problem 

Currently about 25% of all municipal solid waste (MSW) is not collected - more than 500 million tonnes per year.
The amount of MSW is increasing due to urbanisation, population growth and increasing purchasing power; this increase is especially rapid in regions where MSW collection rates are below 50%.
Both uncollected and mismanaged waste have a detrimental impact on
* **climate** - greenhouse gas (GHG) and black carbon emissions from organic waste and open burning of waste, damaging natural GHG sinks (oceans, soils and plants). <!-- , read more here. -->
* **environment** - waste polluting the oceans, leachate from waste, toxic emissions from open burning of waste, wastewater from unregulated recycling activities. <!-- , read more here. -->
* **health** - air pollution, food contaminated with nanoplastics and heavy metals, polluted drinking water, mosquitoes breading in uncollected waste. <!-- , read more here. -->

Despite these detrimental impacts, waste management remains relatively neglected compared to other areas of climate action, global development and sustainability. 

According to UNEP (2015, p.12), [10-15% reduction in global GHG emissions could be achieved][1] through improvements to solid waste management systems - dumpsite closure, waste diversion from landfills, energy from waste, recycling, etc. (not including waste prevention).
According to the World Bank (2018, p.115), even basic improvements to solid waste management systems can [reduce the emissions associated with waste by at least 25%][2].
Despite this potential for limiting climate change, waste management is barely mentioned in IPCC Assessment Reports and was not discussed at UN Climate Change Conferences until COP26 where it was featured in a side event.

Comparing the World Bank's reports from [2012][3] (p.15) and [2018][2] (p.32) shows little progress on waste management challenges.



### What is being done and why it doesn't work

Over the past decade the amount of funding and talent dedicated to addressing waste management challenges has been steadily increasing, yet little progress has been made. 
Having researched the space for more than two years, we identified 3 main reasons for this.

**Many efforts cancel each other out.** Given the scale of global waste management challenges and the lack of progress to date, many new stakeholders have joined existing ones. 
Apart from direct collaborations, there is no coordination between stakeholders, which results in efforts that cancel each other out instead of being complementary.
The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools.

**Reports, webinars and voluntary commitments.** Many efforts backed by a significant amount of funding and talent result in reports and events, which are useful if considered in isolation, but in the context of existing reports and previous events they don't get us any closer to overcoming waste management challenges. 

At the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 nations agreed to "start a dialogue" on loss and damage resulting from climate change, but [a proposal to establish a new funding facility to help affected countries was unsuccessful][5]. 
At the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) the mood is set by the fact that [signatories failed to meet any of the targets they set for themselves][4] at the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010 (COP10).
It is difficult to be optimistic about the potential of the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution that is currently being developed.

**Focus on visible problems and sexy solutions.** Plastic waste is getting all the attention, largely due to the fact that it floats in water. 
While plastic pollution is truly a major challenge, singling out plastic often prevents the development of holistic, financially sustainable waste management systems. 
Efforts like the [Ministerial Conference on Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution][6] in 2021 encourage governments to focus only on a fraction of the whole waste management challenge, thus drastically limiting the potential of successful solutions.

Often the focus is on short-term solutions (like plastic credits) and technology-enabled solutions (usually mobile apps), not on building financially, socially and politically sustainable waste management systems.



### What Samudra is planning to do

Let's change the way we approach change.
To **increase municipal solid waste collection rates in low and middle income countries** we are building Samudra - a **global action network**, a new type of organisation that is neither government, nor business, nor civil society, but a structure that combines resources and competences of all of these.
Our focus is on the waste generated today and in the next 10 years.
This is complementary to [circular economy][7] efforts that focus mostly on building a waste-free future. 

**Large scale change requires weaving together relationships in new ways.**
It requires working with a much greater depth of collaboration than is supported by our current organisational and funding structures.
Samudra will develop and support peer-like relationships among funders (e.g. IGOs, development banks), problem-owners (e.g. national and city governments, companies), methods leaders (e.g. research centres, companies that design and build infrastructure), capacity developers (e.g. waste management companies, NGOs) and other stakeholders.
It is important to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders that usually don’t interact or whose interaction is typically one-sided.

We will focus on stakeholders that are the most motivated to overcome waste management challenges and that are in the strongest position to implement changes on a global level.
Instead of requiring a unanimous agreement of all stakeholders (which holds back UN climate process), we will create [coalitions of the willing][8] - groups of stakeholders that develop their own vision of the future and a plan how to get there.

**The connection is inadequate between the global vision and the micro level actions and tools.** 
Samudra will facilitate the development and implementation of a global waste management strategy in full technical detail. 
It will act as a global orchestrator to develop synergies between different efforts (making them complementary instead of contradictory), to deal with duplication and conflict, to amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders, and to identify and address the gaps that impede the change on a global level. 

**An organisation with global reach and no inertia.**
In practical terms, Samudra will be a stewardship organisation that will allow the change to emerge, without attempting to manage the change.
It will have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.
It will facilitate the development of a global waste management strategy and ensure that the strategy keeps evolving along with changing circumstances, instead of becoming outdated. 
It will ensure focus on 15 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Samudra will be funded by impact-based grants. 
In terms of organisational structure, we envision something similar to [Tech Zero][9] - a core team working alongside employees of major stakeholders that have been dedicated to creating change by  weaving together relationships in new ways.



### Why we think it is going to work

### Why we think it is going to work


making a system that works, not patches, using mathematical thinking

focus on structural change not parameters
https://hbr.org/2021/05/overselling-sustainability-reporting:
Other companies that have made sincere attempts to improve their social and environmental performance have generally behaved similarly: They’ve focused on what systems thinkers call parameters—dials that can be turned up and down to change performance without altering the structure of the larger system.
However, researchers have found that those parameters are rarely sources of real impact. The late Donella Meadows, the primary author of The Limits to Growth and a distinguished professor of system dynamics at Dartmouth, analyzed 12 types of intervention that would affect system performance and concluded that parameters are the least powerful. Probably 99% of efforts go to parameters, she wrote, “but there is not a lot of leverage in them.”



crusial was to understand stakeholders, so we did projects





No blame culture.(see about page)


Evidence weighs more than beliefs.(see about page)

Best is the enemy of better. (see about page)


Gavi worked




waste is easy!


it has never been tried before





### Other things Samudra wants to do

##### Need for up-to-date data 

Need for up to date data, with transparent sources

Sustainable development will falter without data https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02139-w


##### Open data 

ensuring equal access to data, even when some organisations might benefit from keeping it private. For example data about how to repair cars https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/right-to-equitable-and-professional-auto-industry-repair.html
like an “open data platform” envisioned for information about how to repair cars https://www.wired.com/story/fight-right-repair-cars-turns-ugly/


making useful data freely available

ESG Book https://www.esgbook.com/ aims to 'disrupt' sustainability sector with free data https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/esg-book-sustainability-sector-free-data/

for example plastic chemical recycling pay-for data

and data of all WM facilities


Making useful data (that takes money to collect, and is easy to sell) freely available to everyone could result in far reaching impact.


##### Knowledge flow

lack of technical knowledge transfer across countries, organisations and waste streams.


##### Funding startups

For example, in 2014, Goldman Sachs partnered with the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation to help address one of the biggest obstacles faced by women entrepreneurs around the world: lack of access to capital. Working together, they created the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, which mobilized $1.45 billion of capital for local financial institutions to lend to women owned businesses. - same for waste?

##### developing new business models

developing new business models - recruit talent from Circular Economy where there are people skilled at it

##### putting technical discussion on the table

Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure that will allow us to put important conversations (about technologies, infrastructure, financing mechanisms, governance and structural change) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments lacking an actionable plan to achieve them.


##### other types of waste

solar, EV, CD, ...


##### data

Improvements will lead to increase of emissions on paper.

understanding future waste - keeping waste composition changes in mind



##### develop new concepts

What if we measured the thing that matters most: “carbon productivity” as suggested by David Peetz from Griffith University. What if we measure "waste productivity" - amount of value achieved by a certain amount of waste? no, how much can be achieved per unit of climate, environment, human health damage

+ rory quote

##### tech converations instead of bringin everyone together

conversations are not technical - make conversations more technical

the need to put really important conversations on the agenda - to foster discussions about technologies, infrastructure and financing  -->

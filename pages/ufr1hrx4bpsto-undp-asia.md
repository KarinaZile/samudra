### 1. Plastic Waste Management Programme: A Partnership

**UNDP ID:** [00100826][4] <br/>
**Dates:** Jan 2018 - Jun 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** many cities and villages in India <br/>
**Budget:** 13.17 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** The Coca-Cola Company 60%, Hindustan Unilever, Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) India, CSR Trust for SDGs in India (CTSI), The Coca-Cola Foundation, UNDP, Governments Of Uttarakhand and Odisha

The focus of this project is on waste pickers (referred to as Safai Sathis in India) and Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs, referred to as Swachhata Kendras in India) where waste sorting, shredding and baling takes place.

**Partnership with Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB)**

The key part of this project was to set up MRFs and waste collection systems in cities across India and to support them through enterprise partnerships.
This was preceded by a selection process, surveys, meetings, risk assessments and legal agreements; and followed by performance monitoring to enhance recycling rates.
Local waste pickers, recyclers, NGOs, shops, hospitals and educational institutions were engaged. 
The project was rolled out in 13 cities in 2018 and in 16 more cities in 2019. 
By the end of 2021 the total number of cities reached 31 and 22 MRFs had been established. 
Through these MRFs approximately 23,000 tonnes of plastic waste have been collected every year from 2019 until 2021. 
The target for 2022 is to collect more than 67,000 tonnes of plastic waste and onboard 9,000 more waste pickers. 

To support these activities, the following actions have been taken or planned:
* an app for use by local governments and recycling partners rolled out in 11 cities, with plans to cover all participating cities
* 84 waste picker Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been established across 18 cities
* almost 2000 meetings have been conducting in participating cities with local stakeholders including municipal corporations and councils, CSOs, NGOs, educational institutions, corporate partners, waste picker SHGs, recyclers, waste collectors, municipal contractors, etc.
* awareness campaigns promoting segregation of plastic waste at source conducted in 26 Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in 5 cities

**Partnership with Hindustan Unilever in Mumbai**

The key part of this project was to set up MRFs in Mumbai. 
3 MRFs have been set up and 1 more is in progress. 
For all 4 MRFs it is planned to install weighbridges and relevant machinery, obtain insurance for the materials processed and stored, and obtain Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) certification. 
So far 336 waste pickers have been onboarded across the MRFs, and there are plans to onboard 650 more. 
MRFs will organise quarterly medical health camps for waste pickers and workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). 
In 2020, these MRFs collected 1,481 tonnes of plastic waste and 1,037 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in a decentralised manner; and it is expected that these numbers will increase.

To support these activities, the following actions have been planned:
* onboard more than 100,000 households to encourage waste segregation at source (17,661 households already onboarded)
* establish new institutional and enterprise partnerships across Mumbai
* establish new partnerships with authorized recyclers
* conduct awareness sessions or webinars with educational institutions and RWAs
* offer reusable masks in exchange for plastic waste through the "Plastic Lao – Mask Pao!" campaign

**Partnership with HDFC Bank**

As part of this project, MRFs have been set up in Goa (in Panaji), 2 in Uttarakhand (in Rishikesh and Dehradun), 2 in New Delhi (in Delhi Cantonment and SDMC); and 2 more are planned. 
So far 649 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 150 more. 
Due to COVID-19, all onboarded waste pickers were provided with safety gear including clothing and gloves. 
More than 250 meetings and training sessions have been conducted for waste pickers, and 450 waste pickers have participated in social inclusion activities. 
In these MRFs 1,492 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in 2020, and the amount doubled in 2021. 
To support plastic waste collection, an awareness campaign covered 1,045 households in 2020 and 55 educational institutions in 2021.

**Partnership with Nayara Energy in Gujarat**

This project takes place in 2 cities and 15 villages. 
Baseline studies have been conducted in all locations and consents from Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and rural authorities have been obtained.
An MRF has been set up in Khambhalia; setting up of an MRF in the second city and segregation sheds in the villages is in progress. 
So far 98 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 200 more. 
The goals are to establish 10 waste picker SHGs and to organise workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about PSEA. 
The target for 2022 is to process 600 tonnes of plastic waste.

To support these activities, the following actions have been planned:
* set up data mapping and monitoring systems at all locations
* install 20 Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)
* conduct 10 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities and onboard 5,000 households to foster segregation at source
* organise 10 spot beautification activities, including wall paintings

**Partnership with The Coca-Cola India Foundation**

As part of this project, MRFs in 3 cities have been set up with consents from ULBs; and 3 more are planned for 2022. 
So far 268 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 200 more. 
90 waste pickers were provided with safety gear including clothing and gloves. 
4 waste picker Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been established, and 5 more are in progress. 
Plans for 2022 include social inclusion and livelihood activities for formalization of waste pickers and recognition of their service to the society, and workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about PSEA. 
In these 3 MRFs 2,069 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in 2021, and it is expected that these numbers will increase.
To support plastic waste collection, an awareness campaign that will cover 3,000 households is planned for 2022.

### 2. Reducing Releases of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) and Unintentional Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)

**UNDP ID:** [00091789][16] <br/>
**Dates:** Mar 2016 - Mar 2021 <br/>
**Location:** Java island, Indonesia <br/>
**Budget:** 4.84 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Global Environment Fund (GEF)

Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE) are a type of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). 
PBDEs are used as flame retardants in plastics; for example in electronics, construction materials, coatings, furniture padding, textiles and baby clothes. 
Some PBDEs demonstrate [high affinity for lipids][18] and can accumulate in the fatty tissues in human bodies. 
PBDEs have been associated with tumors, neurodevelopmental toxicity and thyroid hormone imbalance. 
Children exposed to PBDEs are prone to subtle but measurable developmental problems; PBDEs can be passed on to children through breast milk. 

The focus of this project is on reducing releases of PBDEs from waste mismanagement, unsuitable recycling practices and manufacturing of plastic products.
To prevent PBDEs from being released into the environment or entering recycled materials, UNDP supported the Ministry of Industry in destroying PBDE containing plastic waste.

In 2018, several key documents had been developed - a draft of the Regulations on Monitoring and Controlling PBDE containing products, a draft of the National Standard for Power banks, and Technical Guidelines for PBDE Free Quality Assurance (based on ISO 9001:2015). 
A draft of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for electronic products was also developed and disseminated by the Ministry of Industry to electronic and electrical industries, plastic recycling industry and relevant stakeholders. 
This was followed by finalising of the National Standard (SNI IEC:62321) for proper identification of PBDEs in products by the Ministry of Industry in 2019.

A training module for manufacturers on using flame retardants and identification of PBDEs in industrial raw materials (both virgin and recycled) has been developed. 
In addition, the Laboratory Information System (SIL) Dashboard and PBDE website have been set up, and an XRF Analyzer Spectrometer for PBDE screening has been procured. 
There are plans to conduct technical capacity training on testing for PBDEs for customs officers.

Training of Trainers (ToT) for awareness of the dangers of PBDEs, health protection and financial literacy modules for recyclers took place in Cikarang in West Java and Mojokerto in East Java. 
The plastics recycling sector, as the key sector handling PBDE containing plastic waste, now has information about best available techniques (BAT) and best environmental practice (BEP) that have been developed recently. 
In addition, draft technical guidelines for reducing unintentional release of PBDEs have been published. 

As part of the project, 7 mini depots will been set up or upgraded and their staff trained:
* in Depok in West Java, focussing on construction of the building
* in Bandung Municipality in West Java, focussing on building renovation and procurement of equipment for plastic waste processing
* in Cirebon in West Java, focussing on set up and procurement of equipment
* in Mojokerto in East Java, focussing on set up and procurement of equipment
* in Malang Municipality in East Java, focussing on procurement of equipment for plastic and organic waste processing
* in Malang Regency in East Java, focussing on procurement of equipment for plastic and organic waste processing
* in Banyuwangi Regency in East Java, focusing on procurement of a drying machine

These mini depots are designed for safe destruction of PBDE containing plastic waste. 
By May 2020, the target of disposing of 1,000 tonnes of PBDE containing plastic waste has been reached.

### 6. Building Circular Cities in Partnership with Private Sector: Starting from Plastic Waste Management 

**UNDP ID:** [00120259][5] <br/>
**Dates:** Feb 2020 - Dec 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Narayanganj, Bangladesh <br/>
**Budget:** 1.10 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Unilever Bangladesh 83%, UK FCDO, UK DFID, HSBC 

With the aim to create a circular economy model for plastic waste, this project focuses on waste pickers (informal economy) and supply chains for plastic waste (formal economy). 
The project is being implemented in Narayanganj, a city of 2.2 million people located 16 km southeast of Dhaka, the capital. 
In Narayanganj, 800 tonnes of waste are produced daily, of which 50 tonnes are plastic waste. HDPE and LDPE plastics form 30% of the total plastic waste.

In collaboration with waste pickers, the project goals were to:
* introduce an ID card system and to enrol 300 waste pickers
* establish a childcare support programme for 300 children of waste pickers
* train 100 waste pickers in waste management safety
* install 20 bathing and hand washing facilities (WASH facilities) for waste pickers in response to COVID-19

By the end of 2021, the waste management safety training module had been developed and 15 WASH facilities were in progress.

In collaboration with the private sector, the project goals were to:
* develop an economically sustainable plastic collection model
* design a supply chain for collected plastic waste
* collect HDPE and LDPE plastic waste and make it part of the relevant supply chain (in formal economy)

By the end of 2021, baseline assessment of the plastic collection model was almost complete, but the collection of plastic waste had not yet started.

To support the HDPE and LDPE plastic waste collection, the goal was to reach 100,000 people with an awareness campaign that would communicate the importance of segregating plastic waste at source and inform about the new plastic collection system and locations of collection hubs. By the end of 2021, design of the awareness campaign was in progress.

**Conclusion:** Evaluation of benefits of the ID card system and the childcare support programme will determine whether similar projects could contribute to the circular economy for plastic waste in other locations. The awareness campaign, if successful, could be rolled out in other cities in Bangladesh. The implementation of the HDPE and LDPE plastic waste supply chain, from collection to becoming part of new products, will provide valuable lessons that could be used across other waste streams.

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** To improve the lives of waste pickers, the goals of this projects included enrolling them into an ID card system, training them in waste management safety and installing WASH facilities for them.

**SDG 5 "Gender equality":** One of the goals of the project was to establish a childcare support programme for children of waste pickers.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** Development of an economically sustainable plastic collection model and design of a supply chain for collected plastic waste are supposed to contribute to responsible production, while the awareness campaign fosters responsible consumption.






### 7. Marine Plastic Litter Reduction Acceleration

**UNDP ID:** [00123967][11] <br/>
**Dates:** Nov 2019 - Dec 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Indonesia <br/>
**Budget:** 1.03 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Norway Ministry Of Foreign Affairs


The aim of this project was to assist the national government in coordinating the progress on the National Action Plan (NAP) for Marine Debris Handling via strengthening of the Secretariat's capacity to  coordinate the five task force units. 
In Indonesia, the Secretariat is the government ministry responsible for providing technical, administrative, and analytical support to the President and Vice President in the exercise of their state powers. 

In 2021, a Reporting System for monitoring and evaluation of progress made on the NAP implementation was established. 
Through this system, the NAP Implementing Team is now able to monitor the progress of each of the ministries. 
This was supported by a policy brief and a database of national and regional government policies on waste management and marine plastic pollution. 
Additionally, evaluation meetings have been held where representatives of the ministries updated each other on their respective ministry’s achievements and future plans. 
An annual report for the President of Indonesia on the progress of marine plastic pollution handling was prepared. 

Integrated national land-based and sea-based waste data platform was created to make marine plastic debris reduction calculations easy. 
A coordination meeting with two maritime transport companies, Pelindo III and ASDP Indonesia Ferry, ensured that their data will be integrated with the national data platform. 

In 2021, a policy brief regarding the use of trash booms in the 10 most plastic-polluted rivers was published. 
This was followed by the installation of a trash boom and a clean-up in the Mangrove Conservation Forest area in Denpasar, Bali. 
The event, organised in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, engaged the local government, fishermen, NGOs and communities.
Separately, waste management facilities have been procured in Labuan Bajo, a tourist destination on Flores island, and design of activities aimed at changing waste management behaviours began.

To increase awareness about the need to reduce marine plastic pollution, social media campaigns have been conducted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram; including the use of InstaStories and short videos on YouTube. 
To reach a wider audience, two live sessions about marine plastic pollution were held on Kompas TV, a national television channel, in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication and Information.   
The youth were targeted through an e-learning programme and EUPHORIA comic and writing competition, which attracted over 1,400 entries from across Indonesia. 

The Secretariat launched the Interfaith Indonesian Waste Charity Movement (GRADASI) in collaboration with the Ministry of Religion, the Indonesian Ulema Council, country's top Islamic scholars body, and the Mosque Council.
As part of this movement, 6 pioneer mosques and 50 branch mosques collected and sold 30 tons of household waste in 2021. 
This was followed by webinars and clean-ups organised by churches, in collaboration with Indonesia Plastic Recycling Association (ADUPI) and two large corporates (Mayora and Danone).

**Dates:** May 2016 - Dec 2021 <br/>
**Location:** Dili, Timor-Leste <br/>
**Budget:** 672,000 USD <br/> <!-- 671,992 -->
**Funders:** Government Of Timor-Leste 60%, UNDP, New Zealand Agency For International Development


The aim of this project was to establish an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) in Dili, the capital, to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.

An awareness campaign, promoting waste segregation at source and recycling, covered Motael and Caicoli villages (referred to as sucos in Timor-Leste) through door-to-door household visits, community-level workshops, events targeting youths/students and consultations with council members.
By the end of 2021, in Motael village 131 (out of 766) households were practicing waste segregation and 211 were practicing 4R (Reject, Reduce, Recycling and Recover) approach; in Caicoli village 105 households were practicing waste segregation and 98 were practicing 4R approach.
In 2021, 50 people delivered recyclable waste (plastic and garden waste) to the IWMF in exchange for rice or a notebook.

At the IWMF, 0.5 tonnes of plastic and garden waste were collected in 2019 and 0.4 tonnes in 2020 (85% plastic).
In 2021, 0.7 tonnes of waste were collected (50% plastic and 50% garden waste); and IWMF produced and sold 224 units of recycled products (bags of compost and plastic products), making 211 USD in income. 

Partnerships with potential buyers of the waste and with local recycling businesses were established throughout the project.

### 11. Domestic Waste Management (Phase 2)

**UNDP ID:** [00127505][17] <br/>
**Dates:** Nov 2021 - Jun 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Vietnam <br/>
**Budget:** 374,500 USD <br/> <!-- 374,709 -->
**Funders:** Norway Ministry Of Foreign Affairs
<!-- Caitlin Wiesen https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-wiesen-56109b16/ -->

The goals of this project are to improve the livelihoods of informal waste pickers and to reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution originating on land and at sea. 
The project will deploy and test a range of waste management models, including on the ground support interventions for waste pickers (who are mainly women), sector-specific waste management models for the fishing industry and ecosystem-level approaches for creating waste value chains through Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs). 
To ensure that the project benefits all regions of Vietnam and other ASEAN countries, the knowledge generated during the deployment of pilot projects will be disseminated and policy discussion workshops will be organised. 

To improve the livelihoods of waste pickers and make them more resilient the following actions will be taken:
* increasing the number of waste pickers who have received safety gear (including soap, masks, and hand sanitizers) from 600 to 1200
* expanding revolving funds available to waste pickers and ensuring that they are effectively management, encouraging access to credit and purchases of equipment
* providing cash for work (for example, beach clean-ups) to at least 800 waste pickers (at least 60% women)

The success of this part of the project will be measured by the increase in income of the waste pickers who benefited from the project (the target is 15-20% increase) and the number of female waste pickers who benefited from the project (the target is 2,000).

To reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution originating at sea, a waste management model for the fishing industry will be developed by engaging with fishermen and women-led cooperatives. 
The following actions will be taken:
* conducting an assessment of needs and developing policies accepted by the local government and local fishery associations
* procuring waste equipment for the boats
* delivering training for the fishermen on waste segregation and environmental impacts of marine plastic pollution
* setting up waste collection points along the shoreline, led by waste picker cooperatives and linked to MRFs
* trialing co-processing of plastic waste that cannot be recycled in an economically viable way in collaboration with manufacturing or waste-to-energy facilities

The success of this part of the project will be measured by the number of actors (boats, fish farms, traders etc.) who sign up to the programme (the target is 80) and the number of tonnes of waste brought back from the boats to the collection points and recycling facilities. 

To reduce the amount of plastic pollution originating on land, an inclusive MRF will be established and local material value chains will be designed. 
The following actions will be taken:
* conduct a value chain analysis (including aggregators, traders and recycling facilities) and map the local informal waste sector 
* facilitate partnership agreements between local government, waste management companies, recycling facilities and waste pickers (including allocation of land, permits to operate and the process of bidding to run the facility)
* procure machinery for the MRF, oversee its operations and establish Standard Operating Guidelines
* set-up a revenue generation models for waste workers based on the supply of segregated waste
* ensure that the MRF operation is financially sustainable, using the network developed under the EPPIC project and the the network developed under the EPPIC projects that arise from it
* develop waste segregation plan and technical guidelines, including tailored guidance for each sector and stakeholder type
* procure waste collection and segregation infrastructure (including bins and sorting equipment) and install it in critical locations around the city 
* conduct a waste segregation campaigns at schools, restaurants, hotels and beaches; using incentives to motivate stakeholders

The success of this part of the project will be measured by the number of female waste pickers collaborating with the MRF (the target is 100) and the number of tonnes of waste collected at the MRF and recycled.

This will then be followed by soliciting interest from other municipalities and relevant stakeholders willing to deploy one or more of the waste management models implemented as pilot projects. 
To facilitate the replication of developed waste management models, policy papers and technical guidance materials will be published and informative workshops will be conducted. 
Municipalities and relevant stakeholders will benefit from the model deployment support, capacity development and knowledge-sharing. 

No updates on the progress of this project are yet available.

With the aim to promote waste segregation, collection and recycling, and to reduce leakage of waste into the environment, this project focuses on development of a waste bank. The project is being implemented in Surat Thani Rajabhat University, where currently all waste that is collected is disposed of at a private dumpsite without segregation.

By the end of 2021, the conceptual design of the waste bank had been developed, with particular attention to integrating IT solutions with economic incentives and public participation.

The goals for 2022 are to:
* manage at least 50% of the waste (both organic and non-organic) created at university through the waste bank
* estimate the reduction in GHG emissions resulting from improvements in waste management system
* develop a waste bank policy for the university and the nearby community

The success will be measured in tonnes of waste diverted from the dumpsite and CO2-equivalent tonnes of GHG emissions avoided as a result.

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Creating a local waste management solution for the university will allow it and the nearby community to be more sustainable.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** This project contributes to SDG 12 by fostering waste segregation and recycling, and by working with the private sector to create a more circular economy.

The goal of this project is to recover low value glass, paper and plastic waste in Samoa and Tokelau.

In Samoa 8 people have been employed to perform glass waste recovery under the Circular Economy for the Recovery of Waste (CERO Waste) programme.
The workforce includes 4 young men and 3 young women with disabilities, and is managed by a female supervisor.
Procurement of a recycling machine for paper waste has been initiated, but the machine has not yet been received in Samoa.

In Tokelau, the national waste management workforce has increased from 1 to 4 people.
All 3 waste management officers are women.

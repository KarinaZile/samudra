<p style="color:#979797;">This review covers UNDP's ongoing and recently completed plastic waste management projects. 
These projects cover a wide range of approaches, some targeted specifically at plastic waste (projects 1, 6, 11) and some at plastic waste as part of municipal (projects 3, 8, 13), healthcare (project 9) or e-waste (project 12).

**Infrastructure**<br/>
In places where waste management infrastructure is insufficient or non-existent, building such infrastructure is essential. 
The projects facilitated creation of a wide range of infrastructure, including Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs; projects 1, 11), recycling infrastructure (projects 3, 11), facilities for processing hazardous waste (project 2), sanitary landfills (project 9), dedicated waste collection points (project 11), Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs; project 1) and bathing and hand washing facilities for waste pickers (project 6). 
It is important to adjust the scale of the infrastructure depending on the population density and the local financial situation, for example building segregation sheds in villages instead of full-scale MRFs (project 1). 

Apart from building infrastructure, it is crucial to develop appropriate revenue generation models for ongoing financing of operations, maintenance and workforce (project 10, 11). 
The key to success is to design sector-specific waste management solutions, for example waste equipment for boats and waste collection points along the shoreline for the fishing industry (project 11), instead of deploying a single generic solution that doesn't meet the needs of any sector. 
When possible, access to infrastructure can be ensured through partnerships; for example using manufacturing or waste-to-energy facilities for co-processing of waste that cannot be recycled in a financially viable way.
It is a good idea to supplement infrastructure designed to facilitate environmentally friendly waste management practices with temporary fixes like trash booms in rivers (project 7), if solutions that can be installed and maintained in a cost effective manner are available. 

Building data infrastructure is equally important. 
The range of solutions that have been implemented through the projects include the ASEAN Plastic Platform (project 5), Vietnam Circular Economy Hub (project 8), national data platform on land- and sea-based waste in Indonesia (project 7) and an app for local governments and their recycling partners (project 1).

**The informal sector**<br/>
<p style="color:#979797;">
(project 1)
SHGs fro waste pickers (p1)
Many of the projects focus on integrating waste pickers (informal sector) into the waste management system. 
To improve their lives, approaches range from revolving loan funds to allow access to credit and purchases of equipment (projects 8, 11), ID cards (project 6), offering childcare services (project 6), safety gear (project 6, 11), good job opportunities (project 11).
organise social inclusion and livelihood activities for formalization of waste pickers and recognition of their service to the society (p1)
integrate waste pickers  into the waste management system (p1)
</p>

**Financially sustainable systems**<br/>
<p style="color:#979797;">
Focus on innovative financial models is essential.
Creation of value chains for waste using ecosystem-level approaches - conduct a value chain analysis (including aggregators, traders and recycling facilities) and map the local informal waste sector (project 11).
Facilitate partnership agreements between local government, waste management companies, recycling facilities and waste pickers (including allocation of land, permits to operate and the process of bidding to run the facility) (project 11).
Making waste management financially sustainable, by cross subsidising across industrial and municipal waste, across neighbourhoods and waste streams.
Ensure that the MRF operation is financially sustainable using the network developed as part of the EPPIC project and the business development opportunities that arise from it (project 11).
Non-monetary incentives, like rice and notebooks for segregated clean recyclable waste.
engaging with private sector (p2)
Increasing the number of partnerships that are useful.
</p>

**Awareness campaigns**<br/>
<p style="color:#979797;">
p1
Awareness campaigns focussed on waste segregation at source (projects 6, 10, 11, 13) and waste reduction (project 10).
Targeting young people, students - the next generation taking care of our planet (project 11, 13).
Incredibly important to educate government officials on SWM and reduction of plastic waste (project 8) and sector-specific people - the fishermen on waste segregation and environmental impacts of marine plastic pollution (project 11).
Engagement through places of worship (project 7). 
Not just awareness, but upskilling programmes for communities and businesses in the tourism sector (project 3).
Facebook, Twitter and Instagram p7
national TV p7
awareness campaign in schools (p4)
awareness campaign on reduction of waste (p4)
awareness campaign on social media (p4)
</p>

**Waste reduction**<br/>
<p style="color:#979797;">
Insufficient number of projects focus on reduction (project 10 8? 4?).
Reducing waste is equally important, even though it is essential to have a waste management system that can be relied on when necessary (for example during a pandemic, when amounts of packaging and other waste increased suddenly).
It is especially true in low population density areas, like remote communities, small islands (project 3, 14).
All of the projects will have a positive impact on climate, even though only one explicitly focussed on reduction in GHG emissions (project 13), but reduction has the most potential.
Focus on quantifying the GHG emission reduction associated with the project has the potential to unlock climate funding for future waste management projects. p13
</p>

**Governance**<br/>
<p style="color:#979797;">
focus on introducing regulations on national level (p2)
Conduct an assessment of needs of the local government (project 11) to ensure long-term success of the project.
stregthening gov capacity p7
both on national and city level (p4)
develop and implement enabling regulatory measures that will support the reduction of plastic waste and increase in recycling(p4)
integrate plastic waste management as a priority into city plans (p4)
</p>

**Conclusion**<br/>
<p style="color:#979797;">
Holistic approaches are always best; more impactful than projects that create portfolios of solutions (project 5). - more likely to suceed
What matters is long term effects of these projects, their **replicability** and scaling up opportunities.
Communicating lessons learnt to decision makers responsible for developing/selecting future projects is key to moving forward globally -  across countries and  across waste streams.
Wide range of solutions explored through these projects is great, now we need to communicate lessons learnt instead of picking "best" approaches.
Explicit focus on disseminating the knowledge generated during the deployment of a project (project 11) is great. 
tempting to compare number of tonnes per usd spent, but doesn't matter

### 1. Plastic Waste Management Programme: A Partnership

**UNDP ID:** [00100826][4] <br/>
**Dates:** Jan 2018 - Jun 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** cities and villages across India <br/>
**Budget:** 13.17 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** The Coca-Cola Company 60%, Hindustan Unilever, Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) India, CSR Trust for SDGs in India (CTSI), The Coca-Cola Foundation, UNDP, Governments Of Uttarakhand and Odisha

The aims of this project are to set up Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs, referred to as Swachhata Kendras in India) for waste sorting, shredding and baling, and to integrate waste pickers (referred to as Safai Sathis in India) into the waste management system. 
This umbrella project consists of 5 projects, each conducted in partnership with a corporate funder.



**Partnership with Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB)**

The aim of this project was to set up MRFs and waste collection systems in cities across India and to support them through partnerships with businesses and performance monitoring to enhance recycling rates. 
Local waste pickers, recyclers, NGOs, shops, hospitals and educational institutions have been engaged. 
By the end of 2021 the project was rolled out in 31 cities and 22 MRFs had been established. 
Through these MRFs approximately 23,000 tonnes of plastic waste have been collected every year from 2019 until 2021. 
The target for 2022 is to collect at least 67,000 tonnes of plastic waste and to onboard 9,000 more waste pickers. 

To support these activities, the plan is to:
* roll out an app for the local governments and their recycling partners in all participating cities (already done in 11 of them)
* establish Self Help Groups (SHGs) for waste pickers (84 of them across 18 cities have already been established)
* organise meetings with local stakeholders including municipal corporations and councils, CSOs, NGOs, educational institutions, corporate partners, waste picker SHGs, recyclers, waste collectors, municipal contractors, etc. (almost 2000 meetings have already been conducted)
* conduct awareness campaigns promoting segregation of plastic waste at source (campaigns targeting 26 Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in 5 cities have already been conducted)



**Partnership with Hindustan Unilever in Mumbai**

The goal of this project was to set up 4 MRFs in Mumbai (3 of those have already been set up).
For all MRFs the plan is to install weighbridges and relevant machinery, purchase insurance for the materials processed and stored, and obtain Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) certification. 
So far 336 waste pickers have been onboarded in the MRFs, and there are plans to onboard 650 more. 
MRFs will organise quarterly medical health camps for waste pickers and workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). 
In 2020, these MRFs collected 1,481 tonnes of plastic waste, and 1,037 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in a decentralised manner. 

To support these activities, the plan is to:
* establish new partnerships with institutions, companies and recyclers across Mumbai
* onboard more than 100,000 households to encourage waste segregation at source (17,661 households already onboarded)
* conduct awareness sessions with educational institutions and RWAs
* offer reusable masks in exchange for plastic waste through the "Plastic Lao – Mask Pao!" campaign



**Partnership with HDFC Bank**

As part of this project, MRFs have been set up in Goa (in Panaji), Uttarakhand (in Rishikesh and Dehradun) and New Delhi (in Delhi Cantonment and SDMC); and 2 more are planned. 
So far 649 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 150 more. 
In response to COVID-19, all onboarded waste pickers were provided with safety gear including clothing and gloves. 
More than 250 meetings and training sessions have been conducted for waste pickers, and 450 waste pickers have participated in social inclusion activities. 
In 2020 these MRFs processed 1,492 tonnes of plastic waste; and double that amount in 2021. 
To support plastic waste collection, an awareness campaign covered 1,045 households in 2020 and 55 educational institutions in 2021.



**Partnership with Nayara Energy in Gujarat**

This project takes place in 2 cities and 15 villages. 
Baseline studies have been conducted in all locations and consents from Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and rural authorities have been obtained. 
The goal is to set up MRFs in both cities and segregation sheds in the villages (MRF in Khambhalia has already been set up). 
So far 98 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 200 more. 
The target for 2022 is to process 600 tonnes of plastic waste.

To support these activities, the plan is to:
* set up data collection and monitoring systems at all locations
* install 20 Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)
* establish 10 waste picker SHGs and to organise workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about PSEA
* conduct 10 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities and onboard 5,000 households to foster segregation at source
* organise 10 spot beautification activities, including wall paintings



**Partnership with The Coca-Cola India Foundation**

The goal of this project was to set up 6 MRFs (3 of those have already been set up with consents from ULBs).
So far 268 waste pickers have been onboarded (and 90 of them provided with safety gear including clothing and gloves), and there are plans to onboard 200 more. 
In 2021 these MRFs processed 2,069 tonnes of plastic waste. 

To support these activities, the plan is to:
* establish 9 waste picker SHGs (4 have already been established) and to organise workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about PSEA
* organise social inclusion and livelihood activities for formalization of waste pickers and recognition of their service to the society
* conduct an awareness campaign that will cover 3,000 households



**Conclusion:** These 5 projects, each conducted in partnership with a corporate funder, have the potential to kickstart efficient waste management systems in cities and villages across India. 
The range of approaches used to integrate waste pickers into the waste management system is commendable. 

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** The focus of this project is on improving lives of waste pickers and integrating them into the waste management system by providing them with good work opportunities and safety gear, setting up SHGs for them and organising social inclusion and livelihood activities for formalization of waste pickers and recognition of their service to the society.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** Establishing partnerships with companies and increasing the amount of recycling are supposed to contribute to responsible production, while the awareness campaign fosters responsible consumption.

**SDG 15 "Life on land":** By improving waste management systems and, as a result, reducing open burning and dumping of waste this project will protect soils, ground waters and air quality. 









### 2. Reducing Releases of PBDEs and Unintentional POPs

**UNDP ID:** [00091789][16] <br/>
<!-- Preceded by "00072772" -->
**Dates:** Mar 2016 - Mar 2021 <br/>
**Location:** Java island, Indonesia <br/>
**Budget:** 4.84 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Global Environment Fund (GEF)

Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) are a type of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). 
PBDEs are used as flame retardants in plastic products; for example in electronics, construction materials, coatings, furniture padding, textiles and baby clothes. 
Some PBDEs demonstrate [high affinity for lipids][18] and can accumulate in the fatty tissues in human bodies. 
PBDEs have been associated with tumors, neurodevelopmental toxicity and thyroid hormone imbalance. 
Children exposed to PBDEs are prone to subtle but measurable developmental problems; PBDEs can be passed on to children through breast milk. 

The focus of this project was on reducing release of PBDEs during waste mismanagement, recycling and plastic product manufacturing activities.
To prevent PBDEs from being released into the environment or entering recycled materials, UNDP supported the Ministry of Industry in destroying PBDE containing plastic waste.

In 2018, several key documents had been drafted - the Regulations on Monitoring and Controlling PBDE containing products, the National Standard for Power banks, and Technical Guidelines for PBDE Free Quality Assurance (based on ISO 9001:2015). 
A draft of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for electronic products was also developed and disseminated by the Ministry of Industry to electronic and electrical industries, plastic recycling industry and relevant stakeholders. 
This was followed by finalising of the National Standard (SNI IEC:62321) for proper identification of PBDEs in products by the Ministry of Industry in 2019.

A training module for manufacturers on using flame retardants and identification of PBDEs in industrial raw materials (both virgin and recycled) has been developed. 
In addition, the Laboratory Information System Dashboard and PBDE website have been set up, and an XRF Analyzer Spectrometer for PBDE screening has been procured. 
There were plans to conduct technical capacity training on testing for PBDEs for customs officers.

Training of Trainers (ToT) for awareness of the dangers of PBDEs, health protection and financial literacy modules for recyclers took place in Cikarang in West Java and Mojokerto in East Java. 
The plastics recycling sector, as the key sector handling PBDE containing plastic waste, now has the information about the best available techniques (BAT) and the best environmental practice (BEP) that have been developed recently. 
In addition, a draft of technical guidelines for reducing unintentional release of PBDEs has been published. 

Seven mini depots designed for safe destruction of PBDE containing plastic waste were set up and staffed with trained workers. 
These are located in West Java (in Depok, Bandung Municipality and Cirebon) and East Java (in Mojokerto, Malang Municipality, Malang Regency and Banyuwangi Regency).
Depending on the location, the goals included construction of a building, renovation and procurement of equipment (drying machines, plastic and organic waste processing equipment).
The target of disposing of 1,000 tonnes of PBDE containing plastic waste was reached by May 2020.

**Conclusion:** The project was designed to solve the challenge with PBDE containing plastics by destroying existing PBDE containing plastic waste, creating proper regulations on PBDE containing products and guidelines for identification of PBDEs in products, and training customs officers to ensure control over presence on PBDEs in the country. 
The facilities set up for destruction of PBDE containing waste could be used for other waste management operations in the following years. 

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** This project engaged manufacturers and recyclers and contributed to the development of the EPR scheme for electronic products, thus fostering responsible production.

**SDG 15 "Life on land":** The aim of this project is to protect the environment from contamination with PBDEs.










### 3. Integrated Island Waste Management in Malaysia

**UNDP ID:** [00127243][12] <br/>
**Dates:** Jul 2021 - Dec 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** 3 islands in Malaysia <br/>
**Budget:** 2.41 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Government Of Malaysia

The aim of this project is to develop integrated sustainable waste management solutions for islands in Malaysia and implement them on 3 islands (Redang and Perhentian in Terengganu state and Besar in Johor state). 
The goals are to:
* complete assessments of current waste generation patterns and waste management practices, and current impacts of waste on environmental and social wellbeing
* implement effective waste management systems on 3 islands by building infrastructure and procuring necessary machinery
* conduct upskilling programmes on waste management and sustainable community-led tourism practices for local communities and service providers 

By the end of 2021, the assessment for Besar was in progress, while the assessments for Redang and Perhentian were due to start once the Letter of Agreement had been signed by the Terengganu State Secretary Office.

**Conclusion:** If the project is successful, a similar 3 step approach could be replicated on other islands with a developed tourism sector in Malaysia and other ASEAN countries.

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Implementing effective waste management systems on small islands will allow local communities to be more sustainable.

**SDG 14 "Life below water":** Targeting small islands with developed tourism sectors will reduce marine plastic pollution originating from there.






### 4. Combatting Marine Plastic Litter in Cambodia

**UNDP ID:** [00119646][13] <br/>
**Dates:** Dec 2020 - Jul 2023 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** 6 province capitals in Cambodia <br/>
**Budget:** 2.46 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Government Of Japan 98%, UNDP

The aims of this project are to reduce the amount of plastic waste and, as a result, to reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution. 
The national-level goals are to:
* identify best practices to reduce plastic waste by private sector and citizens, and feature them on the circular economy platform
* develop and implement enabling regulatory measures to support the reduction of plastic waste, introduction of alternatives and increase in recycling 
* adopt a circular economy strategy and action plans

The city-level goals are to:
* integrate plastic waste management as a priority into city plans of Phnom Penh, the capital, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville 
* develop an operational solid waste management plan in at least 1 city
* ensure that at least 20 businesses (primarily in the tourism sector) adopt single-use plastic reduction measures and foster recycling

The above will be supported by an awareness campaign, for which the goals are to:
* develop educational and awareness raising materials for dissemination in public schools (posters, videos, cartoons, a website and a campaign on social media)
* conduct training on plastic crisis and solutions, and introduce single-use plastic reduction measures in at least 30 public schools in five province capitals (Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, Khemarak Phoumin, Kampot and Kep)
* reach 1 million people with an awareness raising social media campaign encouraging appropriate plastic waste management

No updates on the progress of this project are yet available.

**Conclusion:** The goals to develop and implement enabling regulatory measures for waste reduction and recycling and to integrate plastic waste management as a priority into city plans, if successful, will be the key achievements of this project. 
The focus on waste reduction is commendable. 

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** Engaging with local businesses and focus on waste reduction are supposed to contribute to responsible production, while the awareness campaign fosters responsible consumption.

**SDG 14 "Life below water":** By tackling the challenge both on national and city levels this project has the potential to reduce marine plastic pollution.








### 5. Ending Plastic Pollution Innovation Challenge (EPPIC)

**UNDP ID:** [00119237][15] <br/>
**Dates:** Dec 2019 - Jun 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand <br/>
**Budget:** 1.70 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Norwegian Agency For Development Cooperation

The aim of this project is to reduce plastic pollution in coastal areas in ASEAN countries through regional efforts. 
The goals are to: 
* create a portfolio of solutions for ASEAN countries 
* design scaling up and replication strategies for these solutions 
* attract national and regional organisations to join the ASEAN Plastic Platform hosted by the UNDP 
* increase the number of partnerships focussed on marine plastic management in ASEAN countries 
* seek approvals of Global Treaty on Marine Plastic Waste from the governments

In 2020, 159 solutions were submitted by stakeholders in Vietnam. 
In 2021, 140 partnerships focussed on marine plastic management were pitched in Indonesia and Philippines. 
A pilot project was implemented in Ha Long, a tourist destination in Quang Ninh province in Vietnam.

**Conclusion:** The focus on best practices and developing impactful partnerships are the strengths of this project. 
There is a danger that a collection of individual solutions will not result in a well functioning waste management system. 

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Improving plastic waste management will allow cities and communities to be more sustainable.

**SDG 14 "Life below water":** Improving plastic waste management on land will reduce marine plastic pollution in ASEAN region.









### 6. Building Circular Cities in Partnership with Private Sector: Starting from Plastic Waste Management 

**UNDP ID:** [00120259][5] <br/>
**Dates:** Feb 2020 - Dec 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Narayanganj, Bangladesh <br/>
**Budget:** 1.10 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Unilever Bangladesh 83%, UK FCDO, UK DFID, HSBC 

With the aim to create a circular economy model for plastic waste, this project focuses on waste pickers (informal economy) and supply chains for plastic waste (formal economy). 
The project takes place in Narayanganj, a city of 2.2 million people located 16 km southeast of Dhaka, the capital. 
Narayanganj city produces 800 tonnes of waste per day, of which 50 tonnes are plastic waste. 
HDPE and LDPE plastics form 30% of the total plastic waste. 

The goals in the informal economy are to:
* introduce an ID card system and enrol 300 waste pickers
* establish a childcare support programme for 300 children of waste pickers
* conduct waste management safety training for 100 waste pickers
* install 20 bathing and hand washing facilities (WASH facilities) for waste pickers in response to COVID-19

By the end of 2021, the waste management safety training module had been developed and 15 WASH facilities were in progress.

The goals in the formal economy are to:
* develop a financially sustainable plastic collection model
* design a supply chain for collected plastic waste
* collect HDPE and LDPE plastic waste and make it part of the relevant supply chain

By the end of 2021, baseline assessment of the plastic collection model was almost complete, but the collection of plastic waste had not yet started.

To support the HDPE and LDPE plastic waste collection, the goal was to reach 100,000 people with an awareness campaign that would communicate the importance of segregating plastic waste at source and inform about the new plastic collection system and locations of collection hubs. By the end of 2021, design of the awareness campaign was in progress.

**Conclusion:** If successful, approaches like the ID card system and the childcare support programme could be replicated in other locations to contribute to integrating waste pickers into the formal economy. 
Lessons learnt from developing financially sustainable waste collection models and designing supply chains for waste should be disseminated across other locations and waste streams.

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** To improve the lives of waste pickers, the goals of this project included enrolling them into an ID card system, training them in waste management safety and installing WASH facilities for them.

**SDG 5 "Gender equality":** One of the goals of the project is to establish a childcare support programme for children of waste pickers.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** Development of a financially sustainable plastic collection model and design of a supply chain for collected plastic waste are supposed to contribute to responsible production, while the awareness campaign fosters responsible consumption.






### 7. Marine Plastic Litter Reduction Acceleration

**UNDP ID:** [00123967][11] <br/>
**Dates:** Nov 2019 - Dec 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Indonesia <br/>
**Budget:** 1.03 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Norway Ministry Of Foreign Affairs


The aim of this project was to assist the national government with implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) for Marine Debris Handling by strengthening the Secretariat's capacity to coordinate the progress of the five task force units. 
In Indonesia, the Secretariat is the government ministry responsible for providing technical, administrative, and analytical support to the President and Vice President in the exercise of their state powers. 

In 2021, a reporting system for monitoring progress on the NAP implementation was established. 
The NAP Implementation Team is now able to easily monitor the progress of each of the ministries through this system.
Evaluation meetings have been held where representatives of the ministries updated each other on their respective ministry’s achievements and future plans. 
A database of all national and regional government policies on waste management and marine plastic pollution was created. 
An annual report for the President of Indonesia on the progress of marine plastic pollution handling was prepared. 

Integrated national data platform on land- and sea-based waste was created to make calculations of reduction in marine plastic pollution easy. 
A coordination meeting with two maritime transport companies, Pelindo III and ASDP Indonesia Ferry, ensured that their data will be integrated with the national data platform. 

In 2021, a policy brief regarding the use of trash booms in the 10 most plastic-polluted rivers was published. 
This was followed by a clean-up and an installation of a trash boom in the Mangrove Conservation Forest area in Denpasar, Bali. 
The event, organised in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, engaged the local government, fishermen, NGOs and communities.
Separately, waste management facilities have been procured in Labuan Bajo, a tourist destination on Flores island, and design of activities aimed at changing waste management behaviours began.

To increase awareness about the need to reduce marine plastic pollution, social media campaigns have been conducted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. 
To reach a wider audience, two live sessions about marine plastic pollution were held on Kompas TV, a national television channel, in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication and Information. 
The youth were targeted through an e-learning programme and EUPHORIA comic and writing competition, which attracted over 1,400 entries from across Indonesia. 

The Secretariat launched the Interfaith Indonesian Waste Charity Movement (GRADASI) in collaboration with the Ministry of Religion, the Indonesian Ulema Council, country's top Islamic scholars body, and the Mosque Council. 
As part of this movement, 56 mosques collected and sold 30 tons of household waste in 2021. 
This was followed by webinars and clean-ups organised by churches, in collaboration with Indonesia Plastic Recycling Association (ADUPI) and two large corporates (Mayora and Danone). 

**Conclusion:** This project combines assisting the government with coordinating the progress on reducing marine plastic pollution with building infrastructure (waste management facilities and trash booms) and awareness campaigns (through social media, national television and places of worship). 
If approaches like a reporting system for monitoring progress on a national level, dedicated meetings between representatives of different ministries, a database of all relevant policies and a national data platform on waste prove successful, similar approaches could be used in other ASEAN countries. 
If trash booms prove to be cheap to install and easy to maintain, they could be installed in key locations in the region's rivers. 

**SDG 11 "Sustainable Cities and Communities":** This project contributes to fostering sustainable communities by engaging different types of people through social media, national television and places of worship.

**SDG 14 "Life below water":** By focussing both on waste infrastructure and on government's functions, waste management policies and waste data, this project will contribute to the reduction of the amount of marine plastic pollution.







### 8. Domestic Waste and Plastic

**UNDP ID:** [00117761][10] <br/>
**Dates:** Sep 2019 - Oct 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** 5 cities in Vietnam <br/>
**Budget:** 1.16 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Norway Ministry Of Foreign Affairs

The aims of this project are to introduce effective solid waste management systems in 5 cities and, as a result, to reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution. 
The goals are to: 
* conduct studies of the solid waste management (SWM) systems in 5 cities (Ha Long, Quy Nhon, Mui Ne, Binh Duong and Da Lat) 
* create action plans for capacity building 
* establish revolving loan funds managed by the Women’s Union to improve waste picker access to credit
* educate government officials on SWM and reduction of plastic waste
* develop a circular economy training programme

In 2019, a study of the SWM systems in Binh Duong was completed.
In 2021, a draft decree on circular economy was submitted to the government and the Vietnam Circular Economy Hub was launched.

**Conclusion:** The focus on improving waste picker access to credit and education of government officials on SWM and reduction of plastic waste are the strengths of this project. 
This project will likely have to be followed by a project focussed on building necessary waste management infrastructure.

**SDG 5 "Gender equality":** Establishing revolving loan funds managed by the Women’s Union will improve women's access to credit and support their financial independence and wellbeing.

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Introducing effective solid waste management systems in cities will allow them to be more sustainable.

**SDG 14 "Life below water":** Improving plastic waste management on land will reduce marine plastic pollution originating from cities in Vietnam.






### 9. Healthcare Waste Management

**UNDP ID:** [00126002][9] <br/>
**Dates:** Jan 2021 - Jul 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:**  Monaragala, Sri Lanka <br/>
**Budget:** 721,000 USD <br/> <!-- 721,206 -->
**Funders:** Government Of Sri Lanka 51%, UNDP

The aim of this project is to develop a safe local waste management solution for healthcare waste in Monaragala, Sri Lanka.
The goals are to: 
* implement of a Comprehensive Healthcare Waste Management plan
* ensure that the local government has a technical design and an Environmental Protection License (EPL) for an engineered sanitary landfill
* publish national Healthcare Waste Management guidelines based on lessons learnt from the project

The success of the project will be measured by the proportion of healthcare waste that is managed in accordance with the new guidelines in two pre-selected hospitals.

**Conclusion:** If the project is successful, similar local waste management solutions for healthcare waste could be replicated in other parts of Sri Lanka and other countries. 
It is essential to ensure that access to landfills containing healthcare waste is carefully managed to prevent infections and injuries caused by sharp objects.

**SDG 3 "Good health and wellbeing":** A safe local waste management solution for healthcare waste will minimise chances of infection due to contact with waste.

**SDG 15 "Life on land":** Reducing open burning and dumping of healthcare waste will protect soils, ground waters and air quality. 






### 10. Mobilize Social Business to Accelerate Achievement of Timor‐Leste Millennium Development Goals

**UNDP ID:** [00100474][6] <br/>
**Dates:** May 2016 - Dec 2021 <br/>
**Location:** Dili, Timor-Leste <br/>
**Budget:** 672,000 USD <br/> <!-- 671,992 -->
**Funders:** Government Of Timor-Leste 60%, UNDP, New Zealand Agency For International Development


The aims of this project were to establish an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) in Dili, the capital, and, as a result, to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.

An awareness campaign promoting waste segregation at source and 4R (Reject, Reduce, Recycle and Recover) approach covered Motael and Caicoli neighbourhoods (referred to as sucos in Timor-Leste) through door-to-door household visits, community-level workshops, events targeting youths/students and consultations with local council members.
By the end of 2021, in Motael neighbourhood 131 (out of 766) households were practicing waste segregation and 211 were practicing 4R approach; in Caicoli neighbourhood 105 households were practicing waste segregation and 98 were practicing 4R approach.
In 2021, 50 people delivered plastic and/or garden waste to the IWMF in exchange for rice or notebooks.

At the IWMF, 0.5 tonnes of plastic and garden waste were collected in 2019, 0.4 tonnes in 2020 (85% plastic), and 0.7 tonnes in 2021 (50% plastic).
In 2021, the IWMF produced and sold 224 units of recycled products (bags of compost and plastic products), making an income of 211 USD. 
Partnerships with potential buyers of the waste and with local recycling businesses were established throughout the project.

**Conclusion:** Establishing the IWMF for recyclable waste management and complementing it with an awareness campaign promoting segregation at source and waste reduction are the strengths of this project. 
If the IWMF proves to be financially and environmentally sustainable and the amounts of waste processed increase as the awareness spreads and the household waste management habits change, the model of financing an IWMF with sales of recycled products could be replicated in other locations. 
Similarly, if successful, use of non-monetary incentives (for example, rice and notebooks) to encourage participation should be considered throughout the region.  

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Improving management of recyclable waste (both organic and non-organic) will allow the communities to be more sustainable.

**SDG 15 "Life on land":** The focus on reducing the amount of waste and the amount waste going to landfill will protect soils, ground waters and air quality, and minimise open burning of waste.






### 11. Domestic Waste Management Phase 2

**UNDP ID:** [00127505][17] <br/>
**Dates:** Nov 2021 - Jun 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Vietnam <br/>
**Budget:** 374,500 USD <br/> <!-- 374,709 -->
**Funders:** Norway Ministry Of Foreign Affairs

The aims of this project are to improve the lives of informal waste pickers and to reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution originating on land and at sea. 
The project will deploy and test a range of solutions, including support interventions for waste pickers, development of sector-specific waste management models and creation of value chains for waste using ecosystem-level approaches. 
To ensure that the project benefits all regions of Vietnam and other ASEAN countries, the knowledge generated during the deployment of pilot projects will be disseminated and policy discussion workshops will be organised. 

To improve the lives of waste pickers and to make them more resilient the goals are to:
* increase the number of waste pickers who have received safety gear (including soap, masks, and hand sanitizers) from 600 to 1200
* expand revolving loan funds available to waste pickers, ensure that the funds are effectively management, and encourage access to credit and purchases of equipment
* provide cash for work (for example, beach clean-ups) to at least 800 waste pickers (at least 60% women)

The success of this part of the project will be measured by the increase in income of the waste pickers who benefited from the project (the target is 15-20% increase) and the number of female waste pickers who benefited from the project (the target is 2,000).

To reduce the amount of plastic pollution originating on land, an inclusive Material Recovery Facility (MRF) will be established and local material value chains will be designed. 
The goals are to:
* conduct the value chain analysis (including aggregators, traders and recycling facilities) and map the local informal waste sector 
* facilitate partnership agreements between local government, waste management companies, recycling facilities and waste pickers (including allocation of land, permits to operate and the process of bidding to run the facility)
* procure machinery for the MRF, oversee its operations and establish Standard Operating Guidelines
* set up a revenue generation model for the workers based on the supply of segregated waste
* ensure that the MRF operation is financially sustainable using the network developed as part of the EPPIC project and the business development opportunities that arise from it
* develop waste segregation plans and technical guidelines, including tailored guidance for each sector and stakeholder type
* procure waste collection and segregation infrastructure (including bins and sorting equipment) and install it in critical locations around the city 
* conduct a waste segregation campaigns at schools, restaurants, hotels and beaches, and use incentives to motivate engagement

The success of this part of the project will be measured by the number of female waste pickers collaborating with the MRF (the target is 100) and the number of tonnes of waste collected at the MRF and recycled.

To reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution originating at sea, a waste management model for the fishing industry will be developed by engaging with fishermen and women-led cooperatives. 
The goals are to: 
* conduct an assessment of needs and develop policies accepted by the local government and local fishery associations
* procure waste equipment for the boats
* deliver training for the fishermen on waste segregation and environmental impacts of marine plastic pollution
* set up waste collection points along the shoreline, led by waste picker cooperatives and linked to the MRF
* trial co-processing of plastic waste that cannot be recycled in a financially viable way, in collaboration with manufacturing or waste-to-energy facilities

The success of this part of the project will be measured by the number of actors (boats, fish farms, traders etc.) who sign up to the programme (the target is 80) and the number of tonnes of waste brought back from the boats to the collection points and recycling facilities. 

This will then be followed by soliciting interest from other municipalities and relevant stakeholders willing to deploy one or more of the waste management models implemented as pilot projects. 
To facilitate the replication of developed waste management models, policy papers and technical guidance materials will be published and informative workshops will be conducted. 

No updates on the progress of this project are yet available.

**Conclusion:** The waste value chain analysis, mapping of the local informal waste sector, assessment of the stakeholders needs, development of sector-specific waste management models and leveraging partnerships established as part of another project are the strengths of this project. 
The focus on replication in other locations and knowledge sharing is commendable. 

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** The outcomes of this project will benefit waste pickers (who are mainly women) by providing them with good work opportunities (at the MRF, at beach clean-ups, etc.) and access to credit.

**SDG 9 "Industry, innovation and infrastructure":** This project is focussed on creation of value chains for waste using ecosystem-level approaches, development of sector-specific waste management models, setting up a financially sustainable MRF and replicating the model in other municipalities.

**SDG 14 "Life below water":** By focussing on ecosystem-level approaches and development sector-specific waste management models (including for the fishing industry) the project will reduce the amount of marine plastic pollution originating on land and at sea.







### 12. Technical Support to Strengthen Chemicals and Environment Initiatives

**UNDP ID:** [00117077][7] <br/>
**Dates:** Jul 2019 - Dec 2020 <br/>
**Location:** India <br/>
**Budget:** 180,000 USD <br/>
**Funders:** UNDP

The aim of this project was to position UNDP as an implementation partner for future projects aimed at improving management of e-waste and other types of waste that contain mercury. 
As part of the project: 
* The "India: Mercury Initial Assessment" report was finalized by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and the inter-ministerial steering committee. 
It includes sector specific National Action Plans, details of regulatory mechanisms and phase out dates for mercury containing products in India. 
This report will impact healthcare institutions, laboratories and other industries that handle mercury containing products. 
* More than 100 Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) have been signed with the private sector companies to foster their participation in the second stage of the Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP-II). 
* The Project Identification Form (PIF) for a project on environmentally sound management of e-waste has been endorsed by the MoEFCC for submission to the Global Environment Fund (GEF). 

**Conclusion:** This project sets the stage for future projects aimed at improving waste management systems for e-waste.

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** The outcomes of this project will benefit people living under the national poverty line as they are disproportionately exposed to toxic substances like mercury, both through informal e-waste recycling and due to living in contaminated areas.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** The project was intended to foster greater participation of the private sector in tackling challenges associated with mercury containing products.

**SDG 15 "Life on land":** The outcomes of this project will protect the environment from mercury contamination.








### 13. Programme Framework of Support in Response to Thailand’s Development Challenges

**UNDP ID:** [00127419][8] <br/>
**Dates:** Jun 2021 - Aug 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Surat Thani Rajabhat University, Thailand <br/>
**Budget:** 143,500 USD <br/> <!-- 143,569 -->
**Funders:** UNDP 70%, The Agriculture And Community Development Foundation in Thailand, Government of France

The aims of this project were to promote waste segregation, collection and recycling, and, as a result, to reduce leakage of the waste into the environment. 
The focus of the project is to set up a waste bank in Surat Thani Rajabhat University. 
Currently all the waste collected at the university is disposed of at a private dumpsite without segregation. 

By the end of 2021, the conceptual design of the waste bank had been developed, with particular attention to integrating financial incentives with the IT solutions.
The goals for 2022 are to:
* manage at least 50% of the waste (both organic and non-organic) created at the university through the waste bank
* estimate the reduction in GHG emissions resulting from the improvements in the waste management system
* develop a waste bank policy for the university and the nearby community

The success of the project will be measured in tonnes of waste diverted from the dumpsite and CO2-equivalent tonnes of GHG emissions avoided as a result.

**Conclusion:** If successful, this project could be replicated in other well-controlled environments like university campuses, office complexes and hospitals. 
Focus on quantifying the GHG emission reduction associated with the project has the potential to unlock climate funding for future waste management projects.

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Creating a local waste management solution for the university and fostering waste segregation and recycling will allow it and the nearby community to be more sustainable.

**SDG 13: Climate action”:** Diverting waste from the dumpsite will result in the reduction in GHG emissions.

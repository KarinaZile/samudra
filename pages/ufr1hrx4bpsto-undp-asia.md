<h3>Bangladesh</h3>

1. **Building Circular Cities In Partnership With Private Sector: Starting From Plastic Waste Management.** The aim is to create a "circular economic model" for plastic waste, with a specific focus on HDPE and LDPE. SDG 12.

	**Status:** [Feb 2020 - Dec 2022][4] Pipeline, Guillermo says Jul 2020 - Jul 2022. [Actual start Feb 2020, Planned end Dec 2022, Progress by Mar 2022 is 75%.][1]

	**Financing:** [Budget 1,095,363 USD;][4] [277,894 USD (25%) spent by 28th Mar 2022.][1] Guillermo says 58,080 USD. 

	**Donors:** [Unilever Bangladesh 912,270 USD; FCDO UK 101,011 USD; DFID UK 48,082 USD; HSBC 34,000 USD.][4]

	**UNDP Atlas Project Number:** 00120259

	**UNDP Atlas Output ID:** 00126111

	**International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Identifier:** [XM-DAC-41114-PROJECT-00126111][1]

	**Contact person:** [Arif Faisal][2] (Programme Specialist at UNDP, was in Bangladesh, now in Tajikistan), Enamul Hasan (Procurement Specialist at UNDP Bangladesh, not on LinkedIn)


	**Notes:**

	According to [this document][3] about Livelihoods Improvement of Urban Poor Communities Project (LIUPCP) Sep - Dec 2020:

	**TODO** Compare of this document to actual outcomes of this project.

	UNDP will conduct a Baseline Assessment and a Seller Buyer Survey to identify the main bottlenecks of the value chain that hamper the value and flow of plastic waste recyclables, especially HDPE and LDPE. The baseline assessment will look at consumers, segregation, collection, storing and sorting, shredding and washing, recycling and manufacturing â€“ including different categories of possible buyers depending on the quality and quantity of the recycled plastic. Specific attention will be given to volumes and frequency or supplies as well as to linked demand side requirements for to generate a circular economy for HDPE and LDPE.

	Bangladesh is the 10th most polluted country in the world with 130,000 - 310,000 tonnes of plastic going into the Bay of Bengal each year.

	Sustainable waste management is an important element for cities and municipalities to pave the way for reduction of per capita environmental impact, and to look at financially viable models to reduce, reuse, and recycle resources. Overarching challenges: extensive volumes of plastic released into the environment; lack of a financially sustainable model for Reduce-Reuse-Recycle of plastic; need for a Champion City to pave the way for reduction of per capita environmental impact.

	[Narayanganj (near Dhaka, population 1.5-2.2 million) became the Champion City.]

	Specific challenges to address in order to create a sustainable waste management and promote a circular economy are: broken supply chain of the waste collection; lack of market linkage for HDPE and LDPE; lack of infrastructure and highly informal waste picking sector; challenging working condition and child labor; lack of transparency in plastic collection, disposal and supply chain; low livelihood standards of waste pickers.

	UNDP signed a partnership with Unilever to develop a plastic solid waste management system in Narayangonj City Corporation. The project will give specific attention to supply chain development of HDPE and LDPE. It will build on market dynamics until storing and sorting. Shredding and washing will be value added by the collection hubs (or plastic collection center) set up by the project. Finally, the project will engage a platform of sellers and buyers to ideate market linkage solutions. The latter will determine value addition contribution of the project after manufacturing.

	There were 8 tasks, which would become plastic solid waste management report chapters, the Scope of Work had 9 items. Estimated work for 60 working days. **TODO** Has this been published?

	According to [UNDP][4]:

	Focus - Eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions
	
	Solution - Promote nature-based solutions for a sustainable planet

	Policy Marker Objective - Gender Equality

	Methods - Capacity Development and Technical Assistance

	Partners - National government and Private sector

	Beneficiaries - People living in urban areas, People living under the national poverty line

	8 indicators for the project (with 2019 as a baseline): Development of ID card system for waste pickers; Development of baseline assessment for economically sustainable plastic collection model; Children of waste pickers supported through childcare activities (300 children are to be covered and supported); % of plastic NCC plastic managed (20% of the collected plastic included in formal economy); % of collected HDPE and LDPE connected to market (20% collected HDPE and LDPE in formal economy); Number of people sensitized to segregate plastic and familiar with project collection hubs and plastic collection system (100,000 people covered with awareness campaign); Number of progress reports and advocacy knowledge product (2 progress report and 1 advocacy knowledge product are to be developed); Number of waste pickers supported on Covid-19 safety (develop 20 WASH facilities for waste pickers [more info here][6] and 100 waste pickers to receive training on safe waste management).

	[2021 results:][5] 300 waste pickers included in ID card system and development of 1 model in progress; baseline assessment for economically sustainable plastic collection model and supply chain design almost completed; 100,000 people covered with awareness campaign; One quarterly report produced and one advocacy knowledge product (Baseline) is in progress; 15 WASH facilities are in progress and training module is developed; 2,473 tonnes of plastic collection is done.

	**TODO** REad about this project - [gather information on current waste management system and develop and roll out plastic waste management awareness campaign for both citizens and waste pickers for behavior change of the communities in DSCC and NCC under Plastic Waste Management program.][7]

	**TODO** I believe [this document][8] is older and outdated by now, confirm that.

	Result: For the prevention of harmful PBDEs enter the recycled material and released in the environment, UNDP supported Ministry of Industry (MOI) in destroying 92,5 tons of PBDE contained plastic waste in 2019. In 2019, Indonesia finalized the National Standard on proper method to identify PBDEs on products,SNI IEC:62321 by MOI. As the key sector in handling PBDE containing plastic waste, plastic recycling sector has better information about Technical guideline of Best Available Technique/Best Environment Practice (BAT/BAP) now. Draft document Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) also was developed and has been disseminated by MOI to electronic and electrical industries, plastic recycling industry, government and relevant stakeholders. Operation a mini depo has demonstrated the safely disposing PBDEs containing plastic waste. Five others mini depo are prepared for full operations in 2020,to fulfill the target of destroying 1,000 tons waste containing PBDE.

	**2020**

	Collecting and disposing 348 tonnes of PBDE-contained plastic waste. By May 2020, the project has reached the target of 348 metric tons of PBDE-contained plastic waste; With this achievement, the project has accomplished the target of 1,000 metric tons of disposing PBDE-contained plastic waste.

    Development of mini depots in Depok, Malang Regency, Malang Municipality, Bandung Municipality, and Banyuwangi Regency (for the mini depot in Depok, the project focuses on construction of the building. While in Malang Regency and Malang Municipality, the project gives equipment for plastic processing and organic waste processing, and training. In Bandung, it gives support for building renovation and provision of equipment for plastic processing, and training. In Banyuwangi, it complements their facilities by providing drying machine and training for the personnel). Please note that for all mini depots the project will conduct training for mini depot personnel. - sThe construction of mini depot in Depok is nearly 100% now (there will be a 3-month retention phase, which will end in September 2020. The equipment for mini depot of Malang Municipality is already placed on the location, waiting for testing and commissioning, which is delayed due to COVID19 pandemic. Likewise, the equipment for mini depot in Malang Regency is also placed on the location and tested. However, there is a problem regarding the equipment as it is not in accordance with specification in the tender document. The project is now asking the vendor to handle this. For mini depot of Banyuwangi, the project has procured the equipment and it is ready to deliver in early July 2020. For mini depot in Bandung, the project is going to start the renovation in July, for two months. Following the renovation, there will be installation of equipment, testing and commissioning, and retention phase).

    Number of GEF M&E requirements met and adaptive management applied in response to needs and Mid-Term Evaluation findings.
    
    Background info:

    The import and use of chemical substances, including POPs, is regulated by the Constitution of the Maldives legislative acts and normative-methodical documents. However according to the NIP (2016) analysis of existing legislation on POPs treatment shows the lack of a normative base for POPs treatment. One of the main challenges encountered in improving the management of POPs, chemicals and their wastes in the country is the fact that legislation regulating certain aspects of chemicals (such as Waste Management) and draft bills of regulations specific to chemicals (such as the Pesticides Bill and the Chemical Regulation) do exist in the country but are not yet adopted or implemented/enforced properly. The same goes for Article 5 of Law no 4/75 “Substances prohibited to be brought into the Maldives”, for which the ministry has formulated the relevant regulation as stated in Article 5, however, it is yet to be implemented.

    The implementation of these regulatory aspects has been said to be delayed due to the unavailability of trained staff, lack of technical capacity, lack of financial resources, lack of high-level commitment and responsibility in comprehending the real impacts of such laws, the lack of a national chemicals database, the lack of a general baseline indicating the usage and disposal of these chemicals, a lack of analytical capacity, among other aspects.

    Since the ratification of the Stockholm Convention in 2006, there has been no specific action towards the environmentally sound management of POPs at national level. The 2016 NIP identifies PCB management as the most urgent priority of the country in terms of POPs management. According to the PCB inventory (undertaken as part of the NIP), potentially PCB containing equipment is present on the five (5) most populous islands of the Maldives. The inventory results indicated that there are 18 potentially PCB containing electrical units, made up of 15 electric transformers and 3 oil filled circuit breakers.

  text: I am the founder of Samudra. Mathematician at heart, I think about any situation as a system of equations. I am happiest when outdoors. After finishing my PhD in Feb 2020, I decided to dedicate my life to tackling global challenges that don't have a profitable solution.

  text: "I am the chemistry whizz at Samudra! Things you might want to know about me: <ul> <li>I love making lists. (Clearly.)</li> <li>I love the feeling of puzzle pieces falling into place - which is why I can't imagine doing anything else but research.</li> <li>I love square donuts. They are arguably easier to eat. They never smear chocolate on your face!</li> </ul>"

  text: I often think about how well we understand each other in a society, and how we may improve our lives if we were better at communicating. Sometimes I get a little overwhelmed when trying to convey an idea, especially given my instincts to optimize everything. One remedy I have relied on is to retreat to nature and delve into the marvellous wonders of the world.

  text: I was born a believer in the idea that everyone deserves a decent livelihood and that we ourselves can be the magic wand to make a change. The more I travelled around the world, the more I studied and volunteered, I realised that I want to do more to join the common efforts in making this world a better place for all.

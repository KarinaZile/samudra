      <p>I am the founder of Samudra. Mathematician at heart, I think about any situation as a system of equations. I am happiest when outdoors. After finishing my PhD in Feb 2020, I decided to dedicate my life to tackling global challenges that don't have a profitable solution.</p>

      <p>I often think about how well we understand each other in a society, and how we may improve our lives if we were better at communicating. Sometimes I get a little overwhelmed when trying to convey an idea, especially given my instincts to optimize everything. One remedy I have relied on is to retreat to nature and delve into the marvellous wonders of the world.</p>

      <p>I was born a believer in the idea that everyone deserves a decent livelihood and that we ourselves can be the magic wand to make a change. The more I travelled around the world, the more I studied and volunteered, I realised that I want to do more to join the common efforts in making this world a better place for all.</p>

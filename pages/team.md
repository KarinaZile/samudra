  text: I am the founder of Samudra. Mathematician at heart, I think about any situation as a system of equations. I finished my PhD in 2019, and since then I've been working on reducing the negative impact of waste on climate, environment and health. We are in a climate emergency and I'm working with an appropriate sense of urgency to deliver impact as fast as possible.

  text: "I am the chemistry whizz at Samudra! Things you might want to know about me: <ul> <li>I like making lists. (Clearly.)</li> <li>I love the feeling of puzzle pieces falling into place - which is why I can't imagine doing anything else but research.</li> <li>I prefer square donuts. They are arguably easier to eat. They never smear chocolate on your face!</li> </ul>"

  text: I often think about how well we understand each other in a society, and how we may improve our lives if we were better at communicating. Sometimes I get a little overwhelmed when trying to convey an idea, especially given my instincts to optimize everything. One remedy I have relied on is to retreat to nature and delve into the marvellous wonders of the world.

  text: I believe that we are facing a number of problems in our world today which we should see as transformational challenges and opportunities instead of burying our heads in the sand. I’m convinced that given the opportunity, everyone can rise to the challenges at hand and contribute to their solution. This is why it’s my conviction that through cooperation and exchanging ideas we can grow together, globally.

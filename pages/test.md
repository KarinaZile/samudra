Samudra is a system accelerator.  
Like startup accelerators work with startups to turn them into successful companies, Samudra works with success-relevant stakeholders to turn a dysfunctional system into a functional one.  

Never heard of system accelerators before?  
That's because we invented the term.  
We did because there was no template for a goal-based organisation that we could follow.  
Samudra is not a for-profit organisation - we don't have a product, a service or even a business model.  
Unlike for-purpose organisations, a goal-based organisation sets itself a very specific goal(s) that can be achieved in less than 5 years. 

We believe that a goal-based organisation is well suited for achieving fast progress on global challenges like climate change, environmental degradation and health.  
Nobody at Samudra likes the idea of a stable job.  
Everybody here wants to achieve the goal(s) and be free to embark on the next adventure, feeling that they have produced a lot of impact during their time at Samudra.  

10% of global emissions are related to waste, and these 10% get the least attention, so there are a lot of low hanging fruits.  
One in 3 people globally don't have access to waste collection services, most of them live in Asia and Africa.  
Coincidentally, Asia is the most densely populated continent, while Africa is the youngest continent and hence most likely to experience population growth.  
These facts inspired Samudra's first goal: creating waste management systems in parts of Asia and Africa which lack waste collection services.

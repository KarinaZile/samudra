The waste management sector accounts for 5-15% of human-made climate impact, and waste management's total negative impact on climate, environement and health is rapidly increasing. 
Our goal is to **increase municipal solid waste collection rates in low and middle income countries**, as currently 1 in 3 people globally have no access to waste collection services. 
To achieve this goal we are building a **global action network** - a new type of organisation, that is neither government, nor business, nor civil society, but a structure that combines resources and competences of all of these.

### What is the problem 

1. impact of mismanaged waste on climate, environement and health

1/4 of all waste mismanaged (500+ million tonnes of waste every year and growing)

amount of waste growing due to urbanisation, population growth and increasing purchasing power

Organic waste is one of the main sources of CH4

tipping point for the ocean?

Open burning of waste 
Black carbon - tiny particles transported over transcontinental distances

40% of black carbon emissions come from open burning of biomass (forest fires, open burning of agricultural, municipal and medical waste)

Black carbon climate impact is 4x greater than CH4 impact

Data is patchy, so this is often excluded from climate models



Damaging the sinks
Our oceans absorb 17% of CO2 emissions and produce oxygen. 
Waste flowing into the oceans reduce their ability to do this.

Leachate from waste, ash from open burning of waste, wastewater from recycling, etc. reduce soil's ability to absorb CO2.

Warmer weather increases ground-level ozone from N2O, CH4, volatile organic compounds and other precursors.
Ground-level ozone is a GHG, and is toxic to life.
China loses 1/3 of its wheat harvest and 1/4 of its rice harvest to ozone.



2. it's relatively neglected
cop26 - first mention of waste

Small improvements to waste management systems in low and middle income countries would lead to great impact in terms of limiting climate change. 

Basic improvements to waste management systems can reduce waste-associated emissions by 10-15% (UNEP 2015) or even 25%+. (World Bank, 2018)

Improvements will lead to increase of emissions on paper.

Waste is relatively neglected (not mentioned in IPCC Sixth Assessment Report - Summary for Policymakers; barely mentioned at COP26)



3. lack of progress
The 2012 report shows that nothing has improved.

status quo
















### What is being done and why it doesn't work

lack of real action
but not lack of funding or talent

reports and webinars are being done

Signatories failed to meet any of the targets they set for themselves in 2010, when they last met, in Japan

plastic treaty will be as bad as Paris agreement


I've spent two years researching the space, and my conclusion is that various efforts cancelling each other out is one of the main reasons why the waste management situation globally is not getting better. 
Many thousands of projects aimed at improving waste management systems are already happening, and the only thing that prevents them from making the world a better place is not the lack of funding or talent, it is the fact that they cancel each other out. 
a long-term goal to come up with, and implement, a global waste management strategy that would amplify the positive impact of all players (companies big and small, local and national governments, NGOs, academia, etc.), without different efforts cancelling each other out. 


commitments, strategies and roadmaps don't lead anywhere


Focus on plastic - no hollistic approaches or systems thinking
singling out plastic doesn't help
and it's not just in the media...
Efforts like the Ministerial Conference on Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution https://sdg.iisd.org/news/ministerial-calls-for-global-agreement-on-marine-litter-plastic-pollution/ make countries focus on wrong things.

policy is not going to get you there or fast


not more investment, but better use of it

conversations are not technical

We need to change the way we approach change

### What Samudra is planning to do

Developing and implementing a global waste management strategy that will amplify the positive impact of all stakeholders in the waste management sector (national and local governments, companies big and small, funders, IGOs, NGOs, universities, etc.) and prevent different efforts from cancelling each other out.

Growing a global network of stakeholders in the waste management sector that will allow us to facilitate fruitful connections across different geographical regions and between stakeholders that usually don’t interact, or whose interaction is typically one-sided.

act as a global orchestrator aligning efforts of major stakeholders in the waste management sector, and to have sufficient capacity to facilitate decision making on a global level.

focus on now+10years
this is complementary to circular economy https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview
not reuse or reduce

My goals are to reduce the climate and environmental impacts of waste, and to minimise the impact of waste on human and ecosystem health. 

To allow change to emerge, not to manage it . we have a vision but not a detailed one

Global action network (not igo) - A new type of organisation
These structures are neither government,  nor business, nor civil society,  but rather are distinguished by their weaving together of the resources amd competences of all of these.




I am focused on structural changes that will lead to large scale improvements for the climate and the environment. Minimising the extent of climate change, improving the quality of air and drinking water, increasing fertility of soils and oceans will benefit everyone. 


the need to put really important conversations on the agenda. This is one of the goals I'm trying to achieve with Samudra.world - to foster discussions about technologies, infrastructure and financing instead of discussing the harm plastic straws do to turtles. 

there are no organisations with an adequate capacity to make global decisions. I think that an organisation that could facilitate decision making in a particular area on a global level has to have technical expertise in that area, good connections to various types of stakeholders across the globe, a vision, and an ability to constantly evolve this vision as circumstances change. I am working towards building such an organisation for waste management.



We need a global sustainability "orchestrator" who would bring everyone's efforts together and coordinate action across different regions and groups of stakeholders. 


focus on structural change not parameters


https://hbr.org/2021/05/overselling-sustainability-reporting:
Other companies that have made sincere attempts to improve their social and environmental performance have generally behaved similarly: They’ve focused on what systems thinkers call parameters—dials that can be turned up and down to change performance without altering the structure of the larger system.
However, researchers have found that those parameters are rarely sources of real impact. The late Donella Meadows, the primary author of The Limits to Growth and a distinguished professor of system dynamics at Dartmouth, analyzed 12 types of intervention that would affect system performance and concluded that parameters are the least powerful. Probably 99% of efforts go to parameters, she wrote, “but there is not a lot of leverage in them.”

Change requires weaving together relationships in new ways. Steve waddell

organisation with global reach but no inertia


substantive action

the actors that are most motivated to develop remedies and that are in the strongest position to demand change

Stewardship organisation

make a difference on a global scale.


we know what to do and we have the tools to do it

coordinating "actual" actions

infrastructure first approach


Big players... 




Tech zero model



What if we measured the thing that matters most: “carbon productivity” as suggested by David Peetz from Griffith University. What if we measure "waste productivity" - amount of value achieved by a certain amount of waste? no, how much can be achieved per unit of climate, environment, human health damage






public-private partnerships

making a system that works, not patches


understanding future waste
keeping waste composition changes in mind


“coalitions of the willing”
Agreements of this sort represent the third avenue of potential acceleration delivered at Glasgow: a greater emphasis, co-ordinated by Britain in its role as president, on moves outside the UN process by “coalitions of the willing”. These are groups of countries, companies and cities which band together and come up with their own climate targets based on action in particular sectors. Notable deals announced in Glasgow by these groupings included one on phasing out coal power, one on reducing methane emissions, one on greening the financial-services industry and one on ending deforestation. In every case some big countries and companies were involved. That gave the impression that COP26 was getting many things done. But in every case some big nations were missing—the coal pledge, for instance, did not include the world’s five biggest consumers of the stuff. Nor do these multilateral processes necessarily have much to offer by way of accountability. https://www.economist.com/international/2021/11/14/was-cop26-in-glasgow-a-success
using every possible stake holder

### Why is it going to work

waste is easy!

it has never been tried before

Grant, because it's not for profit

Gavi worked

crusial was to understand stakeholders, so we did projects


No blame culture.(see about page)


Evidence weighs more than beliefs.(see about page)

Best is the enemy of better. (see about page)


### Other things Samudra wants to do

##### Need for up-to-date data 

Need for up to date data, with transparent sources

Sustainable development will falter without data https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02139-w


##### Open data 

ensuring equal access to data, even when some organisations might benefit from keeping it private. For example data about how to repair cars https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/right-to-equitable-and-professional-auto-industry-repair.html
like an “open data platform” envisioned for information about how to repair cars https://www.wired.com/story/fight-right-repair-cars-turns-ugly/


making useful data freely available

ESG Book https://www.esgbook.com/ aims to 'disrupt' sustainability sector with free data https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/esg-book-sustainability-sector-free-data/

for example plastic chemical recycling pay-for data

and data of all WM facilities


Making useful data (that takes money to collect, and is easy to sell) freely available to everyone could result in far reaching impact.


##### Knowledge flow

lack of technical knowledge transfer across countries, organisations and waste streams.


##### Funding startups

For example, in 2014, Goldman Sachs partnered with the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation to help address one of the biggest obstacles faced by women entrepreneurs around the world: lack of access to capital. Working together, they created the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, which mobilized $1.45 billion of capital for local financial institutions to lend to women owned businesses. - same for waste?

##### developing new business models

developing new business models - recruit talent from Circular Economy where there are people skilled at it

##### putting technical discussion on the table

Creating a virtual centre of technical expertise in waste management systems and infrastructure that will allow us to put important conversations (about technologies, infrastructure, financing mechanisms, governance and structural change) on the agenda of high level meetings that all too often focus on bold commitments lacking an actionable plan to achieve them.

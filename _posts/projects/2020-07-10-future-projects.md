teaser: "In the near future we plan to initiate projects focussed on different stages of the waste management process - from informing the design of products that will eventually become waste to new recycling techniques and international waste trade. These projects will be guided by the in depth research we do. Many waste management challenges are similar in different countries all across the globe; therefore we will increase our impact by sharing what we've learnt and actively learning from others."

teaser: "In the near future we plan to initiate projects focused on different stages of the waste management process - from informing the design of products that will eventually become waste to new recycling techniques and international waste trade. These projects will be guided by the in depth research we do. Different countries all across the globe face similar waste management challenges, which is why we aim to increase our impact by sharing what we've learnt and to actively learn from others."

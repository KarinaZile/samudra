The plastic that is produced is not a problem for the oceans (I really mean only the oceans here). The problem is the waste that is not collected in countries like India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, etc. (much of it is plastics) and instead gets into the rivers that carry it into the oceans. The solution is simple - every populated area of the world must have a functioning waste collection system.

This is the first step.


A note on vocabulary. 

Rubbish - (unwanted) and private
Industrial waste - companies 

Waste that needs to be collected is both household Rubbish and industrial waste
Once collected it can be separated into recyclables and garbage (worthless)




Per volume/weight/effort

Based on price some plastic won't be collected just by market force.







Millions of poorest people in the world spend their days walking around looking for plastic recyclables. They sell them to aggregators that then sell them to recycling facilities. First, their income fluctuates based on what they can find. Second, it's very inefficient. I want to employ those people to collect all trash (including non-recyclable plastics that also degrades into micro-plastics in the ocean, and including waste that is not plastics but can leak contaminants into soil, and is just not nice to live next to). So I want to employ people who have no passports/IDs, and perhaps pay them much below the minimum wage (but still many times more than what they make now). In UK there is only one company that is allowed to employ people that don't have an ID (Big Issue). If it's possible in European Union, surely it is possible in Asia too. I mean to legally employ people that legally can not work.

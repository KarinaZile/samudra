Polypropylene (PP) is a **thermoplastic** from the **polyolefins** group.
The methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, although the chemical resistance decreases.
The chemical formula for PP is (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)n.
PP was discovered in 1951.


### Production (in theory)

PP is a linear hydrocarbon polymer.
The monomer is propylene, the second most produced building block in the petrochemical industry.
Propylene is made by cracking naphtha or natural gas.
It is gaseous at room temperature.
Propylene is transformed into polymers through catalyst aided chain-growth polymerisation.
The polymer can be used in different processing technologies such as injection molding, blow molding, sheet extrusion, oriented film extrusion (to produce Orientated Polypropylene (OPP) film), injection-stretch blow molding and thermoforming.


### Additives

Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary carbon centers leading to chain breaking via reaction with oxygen. 
Polymer stabilizers (UV-absorbing additives and anti-oxidants such as phosphites and hindered phenols) can be added to prevent polymer degradation.



### Production (in practice)

The main [commercial technologies for PP production][1] are Spheripol by LyondellBasell (market share of around 39%), UNIPOL PP (16%), Novolen (11%), Innovene PP (7%), Hypol (4%), Borstar PP (3%), Chisso (3%) and Sumitomo (3%).
The [top 10 producers][1] account for more than 50% of the total production of PP globally.
These include Lyondell Basell, Sinopec Group, PetroChina Group, Braskem Group, Borealis/Borouge, SABIC, Exxon Mobil, Reliance industries, Total PC and Formosa Plastics Corp.
About 50% of PP is [produced in Asia][1] (including China).

### Properties

READ pp https://www.recycling-magazine.com/2021/07/08/recyclass-tests-functional-barriers-in-pp-containers/

Its properties are similar to PE.

Hard but still flexible, waxy surface, translucent, withstands solvents

PP is white, mechanically rugged material.
tough and flexible

PP is slightly harder and more heat resistant than PE. 
Due to the tertiary carbon atom PP is chemically less resistant than PE.

The thermal expansion of PP is very large, but somewhat less than that of PE.


Polypropylene has good resistance to fatigue


Polypropylene at room temperature is resistant to fats and almost all organic solvents, apart from strong oxidants. Non-oxidizing acids and bases can be stored in containers made of PP.


Most commercial PP has an intermediate level of crystallinity between that of LDPE and HDPE.



PP can be made translucent when uncolored but is not as readily made transparent. It is often opaque or colored using pigments. 
PP is dope-dyed; no water is used in its dyeing, in contrast with cotton.

PP resin is resistant to acid, bases and detergents. 
At room temperature, it is resistant to organic solvents.

They have low density, high softening point and offer higher rigidity and hardness. 

PE has less static charge so attract less dust than PP

The PP plastics are flexible, tough, heat resistant and provide a barrier to moisture. 






The density of PP is about 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, crystalline and amorphous regions differ only slightly in their density. 
The density can change significantly with the addition of fillers.






Its melting point is 130-171&#8451;.

Below 0&#8451; PP becomes brittle.

PP is liable to chain degradation from exposure to temperatures above 100&#8451;.

The flash point of a typical composition is 2601&#8451;; autoignition temperature is 3881&#8451;.

At elevated temperature, PP can be dissolved in nonpolar solvents such as xylene, tetralin and decalin.


softens at 140&#8451;

PP has higher melting point than PE





High thermal expansion coefficient limits the high-temperature applications of PP material.

PP is highly flammable and is difficult to paint as it has poor bonding properties.

They are prone to oxidation and UV degradation.

PP polymer has poor resistance to chlorinated solvents and aromatics 


















### Modifications

PP is normally tough and flexible, especially when copolymerized with ethylene.
This allows PP to be used as an engineering plastic, competing with materials such as ABS.



### Usage



* Kitchenware - microwave-safe food containers, plastic cup, baby bottles, cutlery.
* Containers - bottles for detergents and toiletries
* Automotive applications - dashboard, bumper, cladding and cushioning in vehicles. in batteries


A polyolefin is a type of polymer produced from a simple olefin (also called an alkene with the general formula CnH2n) as a monomer. For example, polyethylene is the polyolefin produced by polymerizing the olefin ethylene. Polypropylene is another common polyolefin which is made from the olefin propylene. 



face masks, filters, diapers and wipes.



PP: Packing tape, Plastic Straws, Take away tubs, Ketchup bottles, Plastic picnic ware


It is also used on large scale for clothing. PP material is majorly used in nonwovens, having maximum utilization in diapers and sanitary products as it is treated to absorb water instead of repelling. 

They have excellent aesthetic properties so are used in a lot in automotive sectors where shine and gloss are required on parts such as the bumper.

packaging, automotive, consumer goods, electrical & electronics etc.


PP polymer is one of the most versatile polymers and is used as both plastic and as fiber.

The polymer has tough characteristics like it is mechanically rugged and resistant to many chemical solvents like bases and acids. This makes polypropylene plastic ideal for various end-use industries. The main application of PP plastic is in packaging and labeling, textiles, plastic parts and reusable containers of various types.


medical applications


 Packaging, transportation, building and construction, agriculture, and household items: food packaging and containers (bottle caps, yogurt and margarine tubs, straws, food trays, microwave containers, film for sweet and snack wrappers); medicine bottles, fibers, appliances, and carpeting, stackable crates for transport and storage; water or sewage pipes; geomembrane liners used in building applications; insulation, household items including bowls, trays, combs, hairdryers; automotive parts; bank notes. PP is sometimes recycled. Will float. Is a Thermoplastic.


The properties of PP are strongly affected by its tacticity, the orientation of the methyl groups (CH
3) relative to the methyl groups in neighboring monomer units (see above). The tacticity of polypropylene can be chosen by the choice of an appropriate catalyst during the production processes.


The term tacticity describes for polypropylene how the methyl group is oriented in the polymer chain.
In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the methyl groups are oriented on one side of the carbon backbone. This arrangement creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep
 An isotactic structure leads to a semi-crystalline polymer. The higher the isotacticity (the isotactic fraction), the greater the crystallinity, and thus also the softening point, rigidity, e-modulus and hardness.[14]:22

Atactic polypropylene ( the methyl group (-CH3) is randomly aligned), on the other hand, lacks any regularity which makes it unable to crystallize and  amorphous (not crystalline). 




Atactic polypropylene has lower density, melting point and softening temperature than the crystalline types and is tacky and rubber-like at room temperature. It is a colorless, cloudy material and can be used between −15 and +120 °C. Atactic polypropylene is used as a sealant, as an insulating material for automobiles and as an additive to bitumen.[31]


Polypropylene copolymers are in use as well. A particularly important one is polypropylene random copolymer (PPR or PP-R), a random copolymer with PE used for plastic pipework. 


The large number of end-use applications for polypropylene are often possible because of the ability to tailor grades with specific molecular properties and additives during its manufacture. For example, antistatic additives can be added to help polypropylene surfaces resist dust and dirt. 



Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) is a highly versatile closed-cell bead foam that provides a unique range of properties, including outstanding energy absorption, multiple impact resistance, thermal insulation, buoyancy, water and chemical resistance, exceptionally high strength to weight ratio and 100% recyclability. EPP can be made in a wide range of densities, from 15 to 200 grams per litre, which are transformed by moulding into densities ranging from 18 to 260 grams per litre. Individual beads are fused into final product form by the steamchest moulding process resulting in a strong and lightweight shape.

Thermal Insulation
Can dampen absorb or block sound. 
Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is a foam form of polypropylene. EPP has very good impact characteristics due to its low stiffness; this allows EPP to resume its shape after impacts. EPP is extensively used in model aircraft and other radio controlled vehicles by hobbyists. This is mainly due to its ability to absorb impacts, making this an ideal material for RC aircraft for beginners and amateurs. 
Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam is able to absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in a short amount of time.[61]


Biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP)
When polypropylene film is extruded and stretched in both the machine direction and across machine direction it is called biaxially oriented polypropylene. Two methods are widely used for producing BOPP films, namely, the tenter process and tubular process. [43] Biaxial orientation increases strength and clarity.[44] BOPP is widely used as a packaging material for packaging products such as snack foods, fresh produce and confectionery. It is easy to coat, print and laminate to give the required appearance and properties for use as a packaging material. This process is normally called converting. It is normally produced in large rolls which are slit on slitting machines into smaller rolls for use on packaging machines. 
A common application for polypropylene is as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). These BOPP sheets are used to make a wide variety of materials including clear bags. When polypropylene is biaxially oriented, it becomes crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and retail products. 

BOPP (biaxially-oriented polypropylene) is a variant of polypropylene (PP).



As polypropylene is resistant to fatigue, most plastic living hinges, such as those on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, it is important to ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the hinge to maximise strength. 

Polypropylene is used in the manufacturing of piping systems. This material is often chosen for its resistance to corrosion and chemical leaching, its resilience against most forms of physical damage, including impact and freezing, its environmental benefits, and its ability to be joined by welding (heat fusion) rather than gluing.[46][47][48]


Many plastic items for medical or laboratory use can be made from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles[citation needed]. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). 

Polypropylene is widely used in ropes, distinctive because they are light enough to float in water


Polypropylene is also used as an alternative to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as insulation for electrical cables


Polypropylene is most commonly used for plastic moldings, wherein it is injected into a mold while molten, forming complex shapes at relatively low cost and high volume; examples include bottle tops, bottles, and fittings. 


Polypropylene, highly colorfast, It can also be produced in sheet form, widely used for the production of stationery folders, packaging, and storage boxes. The wide color range, durability, low cost, and resistance to dirt make it ideal as a protective cover for papers and other materials.


Polypropylene fibres are used as a concrete additive to increase strength and reduce cracking and spalling.[52] In some areas susceptible to earthquakes (e.g., California), PP fibers are added with soils to improve the soil's strength and damping when constructing the foundation of structures such as buildings, bridges, etc.[53] Polypropylene fibres are also used in drywall joint compound for reinforcement. It can increase the flexibility and dimensional stability of the joint compound and reduce shrinkage and cracking when it dries. 
When the cathedral on Tenerife, La Laguna Cathedral, was repaired in 2002–2014, it turned out that the vaults and dome were in a rather bad condition. Therefore, these parts of the building were demolished, and replaced by constructions in polypropylene. This was reported as the first time this material was used in this scale in buildings.

Polypropylene is a major polymer used in nonwovens, with over 50% used[citation needed] for diapers or sanitary products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) 


Other non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters.

 The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar[citation needed] floating barriers near oil spills on rivers. 

Polymer banknotes are made from BOPP, where it provides a durable base and allows for the use of transparent security features by omitting opaque inks in the desired areas.

### Recycling

Different recycling methods are available for PP: mechanical recycling, solvent-based recycling, pyrolysis, feedstock recycling (including biological decomposition). 
Recycling PP without a loss of quality is an energy intensive process that results in a lot of GHG emissions. 
Hence PP is often downcycled into lower quality products like park benches or flowerpots.
In 2020 [The Recycling Partnership][2] has launched the [Polypropylene Recycling Coalition][4] - an industry collaboration to improve PP recycling, and to improve recovery of PP and develop the market for high-quality recycled PP in the USA.

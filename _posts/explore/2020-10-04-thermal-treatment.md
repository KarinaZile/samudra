title: Thermal treatment of waste
meta_description: "Thermal treatment methods significantly reduce the volume of the waste and destroy all pathogens present in it. These methods allow to recover the calorific value of the waste in a form of energy, hence they are often referred to as waste-to-energy or energy-from-waste. Incineration, waste combustion in the presence of oxygen, is the only method currently widely used on an industrial scale."

Thermal treatment methods significantly reduce the volume of the waste and destroy all pathogens present in it. 
These methods allow to recover the calorific value of the waste in a form of energy, hence they are often referred to as waste-to-energy or energy-from-waste.
[Incineration][1], waste combustion in the presence of oxygen, is the only method currently widely used on an industrial scale.

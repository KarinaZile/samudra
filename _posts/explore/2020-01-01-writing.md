Indonesia is home to 3.4% of the world's population; and it is estimated that 10% of the global ocean plastic pollution originates there. The Indonesia National Plastic Action Partnership mapped out this challenge.


### Generation

[270.6 million people in 2019][1] in Indonesia

### Collection

According to the data published by the [UNdata][http://data.un.org/Host.aspx?Content=About] the amount of MSW collected in Indonesia has [increase from 2477 thousand tonnes in 1990 to 6027 thousand tonnes in 2015][http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=ENV&f=variableID%3a1814] (assuming that 1 cubic meter of waste weights 0.24 tonnes, which is in line with another study that found that [1 cubic meter of waste in Manado City weights 0.313 tonnes][https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/icest-17/25884959]).
However this data includes only large cities and the number of cities included has been different every year - from 2 cities included in 1990 to 33 cities included in 2011.

[40% of the waste from the urban population is collected][https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/REUSE-AND-RECYCLING-AS-A-SOLUTION-TO-URBAN-SOLID-IN-Damanhuri-Padmi/4e8d2f7aafb6dc510949429e5dcfdb76052b5fd5?p2df]

### Transportation


[The study compared different types of waste transportation  vehicles and found that costs can vary three-fold] [https://www.iaras.org/iaras/home/caijes/financing-of-municipal-solid-waste-in-the-city-of-manado]

### Recycling

Greater Surabaya will also be home to a bottle-to-bottle recycling facility built by Danone in partnership with Veolia

800 SMEs of plastic recycling

Rigid plastic is recycled into bettle packaging, bottle caps and non-food contact items using Blown molding. 
Rigit plasti is also recycled into waste bins, flower pots, containers and houseware using injection molding.
Film plastic is recycled into trash bags and concrete sheets using extrusion and blown film techniques.



### Treatment 




[On July 16th 2019 cabinet meeting, Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed the hope that building waste-fueled power plants in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bekasi and Surakarta might be finished by the end of 2019. The one in Bali will follow, and then the other 7. The President Joko Widodo emphasised that the aim is to solve the waste challedge in these cities, not to make profit on electricity sales. Bantar Gebang, the largest uncovered landfill site in Southeast Asia, receives 8,000 tons of waste per day. Additionally Bekasi itself generates 1,700 tons per day.][https://setkab.go.id/4-kota-sudah-siap-seskab-tipping-fee-jadi-masalah-klasik-pembangunan-pltsa/]
These four waste-fueled power plants will feed into [Java and Bali grid that is already over-supplied][https://news.mongabay.com/2017/11/indonesia-coal-power-push-neglects-rural-households-chokes-urban-ones/] while not addressing the shortage of electricity in under-served areas like Sulawesi.

[The energy ministry expects to have 12 such waste-to-energy plants online by 2022, generating a combined 234 megawatts of electricity by burning 16,000 tons of waste a day.][https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/indonesia-facing-a-waste-crisis-plans-to-burn-it-for-electricity/]

[Indonesia only requires dioxin tests to be carried out every five years, as the country lacks the specialized lab facilities to carry out such checks.][https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/indonesia-facing-a-waste-crisis-plans-to-burn-it-for-electricity/]



[Tipping fees at planned incinerators: East Java - around Rp150, quite cheap. Maximum tipping fee has been set at Rp. 500, so that there is a legal umbrella.][https://setkab.go.id/4-kota-sudah-siap-seskab-tipping-fee-jadi-masalah-klasik-pembangunan-pltsa/]

[PLN and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources are both receiving blame for the slowness of the project.][https://setkab.go.id/belum-ada-progres-presiden-jokowi-ingin-pembangunan-pltsa-ada-solusi/]

### Disposal

[In 2005 after 3 days of heavy rain Leuwigajah  dumpsite  in  Bandung  (Indonesia)  collapsed creating an avalanche of 2.7  millon  cubic  meters of waste. It killed 147  people and destroyed a near by settlement.][http://dr-koelsch.de/assets/images/sardinia_2005.pdf]

Land for new waste disposal sites for MSW is becoming difficult. 
Indonesia is already planning to move its capital to the island of Borneo, as Jakarta - on the north coast of Java island - is slowly sinking and suffers regular flooding. In Borneo landfills will come at a cost of deforestation.


### Bali

10 landfills.

### Ocean pollution


[The 2016 study looked for optimal marine microplastic removal locations given a goal to remove the most surface microplastic or reduce the ecological impact (using plankton growth as a proxy)][https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/1/014006]. The identified locations were off the coast of China and in the Indonesian Archipelago for both goals.

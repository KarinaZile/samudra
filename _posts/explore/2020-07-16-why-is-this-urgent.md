Today about 2.6 billion people that have no access to waste collection services faced a choice of what to do with their waste. <!-- cite -->
[Today 32,877 tonnes of plastic waste ended up in our oceans][7]. 
The damage done in the past 24 hours will have long lasting effects. 
The good news is that this can be changed. 
If we postpone implementing the necessary changes to waste management systems around the globe, they will not become any easier to implement but the benefits of doing so will be deminished by the previously accumulated irreversible damage. 
That is why it is important to act now.


We are all different. 
After an exhausting day at work, some of us long for a walk in fresh air while others crave seafood for dinner. 
Some people are captivated by marine biodiversity that you can only truly experience when diving; others can't think of a more relaxing way to spend a weekend than go fishing. 
Yet for every single one of us, things we love are endangered by the consequences of mismanaged waste. 
In this article we will describe the impact of mismanaged waste on the environment, climate and human health. 



### Environmental impact 

Environmental impact of mismanaged waste can be broadly divided into four categories - the effects it has on the air we breath, the oceans, soils and all life around us. 
[In countries with low and lower middle income level more than 50% of waste is openly burnt][1].
[Emissions from open burning of waste][3] mainly emit particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) including dioxins and furans. 
The resulting PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matter with a diameter of &le;10 micrometers, about 15% of the diameter of a human hair) is small enough to penetrate the respiratory system and [can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer][2].
PM<sub>0.1</sub> (ultrafine particulate matter with a diameter of &le;0.1 micrometers) and PCBs can travel beyond the respiratory system to the central nervous system and, ultimately, reach the brain that [may cause neurological diseases][3].
While most particulate matter present in the air results from industrial activities, fuel combustion and wildfires, open burning of waste is a substantial contributor in many countries. 
For example, [a 2014 study][4] estimated that in China open waste burning is equivalent to 22% of total anthropogenic PM<sub>10</sub> emissions.


[Our oceans contain 96.5% of all water on our planet][6], that is 1,337.5 billion tonnes (see the [visualisation][8] below). 
Compare that to the [estimated 0.012 billion tonnes of plastic waste that entered our ocean in 2010][7]. 
[The study by Jenna Jambeck][7] predicts that the amount of plastic entering our oceans will increase by an order of magnitude by 2025. 
Sunlight, waves and bacteria break down the plastic into microplastic.
After being ingested by filter feeders (animals that feed by straining food from the water, for example krill and whales) and other animals, microplastic travels up the food chain from prey to predator. 
While this has been suspected for a long time, [a 2018 study][12] that looked at seals feeding on mackerel provided conclusive evidence.


Our oceans have a great impact on the Earth's climate as they are a major carbon sink. 
They absorb [at least a quarter of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions][14], or perhaps much more according to [this 2020 study][13]. 
The absorption happens via the biological carbon pump: phytoplankton produce organic carbon through photosynthesis, they then either pass it up the food chain or sink it into the deep ocean (the process called marine snowfall) when they die. 
Krill also play an important role due to their large size (up to 5 centimeters long) and [daily vertical migrations from the deep ocean to the surface][15]. 
[They transport and transform essential nutrients, stimulate primary productivity and influence the carbon sink][17]. 
A widely cited prediction states that [by 2050 there will be more plastics in our oceans than fish (by weight)][16]. 
This prediction does not take into account that [plastic ingestion leads to animal's stomachs filling up, which results in starvation and subsequently death][18].
As plastic breaks down into smaller pieces, various chemicals that were used as additives at the production stage are released. 
[Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of those chemicals][19] and [it has adverse effects on fish reproduction][20]. 
The marine ecosystem is likely to collapse before the amount of plastic in our oceans surpasses the amount of fish. 


[In 1992 a container of yellow rubber ducks fell into the Pacific Ocean][5], and since then [these ducks wash up on the shores all around the globe][8]. 
This accident revealed that all our oceans are connected via a worldwide network of currents. 
A [study by Erik van Sebille][9], with a setup that is very similar to the rubber duck scenario, showed that the waste that starts its journey from the populated costal areas is moved by the currents into the open ocean within months. 
This is how the six major garbage patches formed in the gyres of our oceans. 
The study showed that there is no set destination - waste released from one specific place eventually ends up in all garbage patches; explore the model [here][10]. 
The North Pacific patch is the largest attractor, the study predicts that over multi-millennial timescales most of the global marine debris will end up there. 
While floating plastic waste gets the most attention, [this is only 1% of the total plastic present in our oceans][11].
The rest of it is [contained within the water column and animal animals][21].
Many scientists agree that among all the contaminants (solid, liquid and gas) currently ending up in our oceans, plastic is not the worst.


On land mismanaged waste contaminates the soil via leachate from dumped and burried waste, as well as via pollutants released during open burning of waste. 
Microplastic change physiocochemical properties of the soil, altering the carbon cycle and the water retention properties. 
This [affects plant community structures and often favour invasive plant species][22]. 
Mismanaged waste has detrimental effect on agriculture and food security in general.



### Climate impact 

The World Bank estimated that [1.6 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions (about 5 percent of global emissions!) were generated from solid waste treatment and disposal in 2016][1], not including waste-related transportation. 
The emissions associated with solid waste are predicted to [increase to 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year by 2050][1] if no improvements are made. 
The main contributors are dumps and landfills without gas capture systems, and open burning of waste.
Basic improvements to waste processing systems and increased waste collection rates [can reduce these emissions by more than 25%][1].

[Global CO2 emissions from open waste burning are relatively small compared to total anthropogenic CO2, 

; however, regional CO2 emissions, particularly in many developing countries in Asia and Africa, are substantial][4].







methane
Waste releases methane gas when disposed of in an oxygen-limited environment such as a dump or a landfill. Methane, generated from decomposing organic waste, is the solid waste sector’s largest contributor to GHG [1]

Methane has much higher short-term global warming potential (GWP) than CO2. Over the shorter time frame of 20 years, methane has 84 times higher GWP than CO2 .
it lasts 12.4 years

CO2 
when burning. 

Black carbon (BC) is a particularly serious air pollutant emitted from the uncontrolled burning of waste in open fires because it has a global warming potential (GWP) up to 5000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2) and is also linked to detrimental health impacts. 

 The results demonstrated that BC emissions from open burning of waste have a significant climate impact, equivalent to 2–10% of global CO2Eq emissions. Global BC CO2Eq emissions from burning waste are 2–8 times larger compared to methane (CH4) CO2Eq emissions arising from the decomposition of equivalent amounts of combustible biodegradable waste disposed at dumpsites.

### Impact on human health

This is something we all have in common - desire to be healthy.


Impact on people
- immediate health impacts. The immediate health impacts also include diarrhoea-related diseases caused by direct contact with solid waste or by the consumption of contaminated food, soil or water.
- long term health impacts. the floods and insanitary conditions resulting from the uncollected waste blocking drains lead to up to 4% of diarrhoea-related mortality, which translates into 67,000 - 141,000 deaths a year.
- impact on kids not yet born
- also economic impacts (tourism, fishing)
- mosquito breeding grounds. uncollected waste also creates favorable conditions for the proliferation of mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue and malaria,

Numbers show that 22% of premature mortality in developing countries related to air pollution come from the practice of burning waste where collection is not set up.

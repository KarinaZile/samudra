Today about 2.6 billion people that have no access to waste collection services faced a choice of what to do with their waste. 
[Today 32,877 tonnes of plastic waste ended up in our oceans][7]. 
The damage done in the past 24 hours will have long lasting effects. 
The good news is that this can be changed. 
If we postpone implementing the necessary changes to waste management systems around the globe, they will not become any easier to implement but the benefits of doing so will be deminished by the previously accumulated irreversible damage. 
That is why it is important to act now.


We are all different. 
Some people are captivated by marine biodiversity that you can only truly experience when diving; others can't think of a more relaxing way to spend a weekend than go fishing. 
After an exhausting day at work, some of us long for a walk in fresh air while others crave seafood for dinner. 
Yet for every single one of us, things we love are endangered by the consequences of mismanaged waste. 
In this article we will highlight the impact of mismanaged waste on the environment, climate and human health. 



### Environmental impact 

Environmental impact of mismanaged waste can be broadly divided into four categories - the effects it has on the air we breath, the oceans, soils and all life around us. 
[In countries with low and lower middle income level more than 50% of waste is openly burnt][1].
[Emissions from open burning of waste][3] mainly emit particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) including dioxins and furans. 
The resulting PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matter with a diameter of &le;10 micrometers, about 15% of the diameter of a human hair) is small enough to penetrate the respiratory system and [can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer][2].
PM<sub>0.1</sub> (ultrafine particulate matter with a diameter of &le;0.1 micrometers) and PCBs can travel beyond the respiratory system to the central nervous system and, ultimately, reach the brain that [may cause neurological diseases][3].
While most particulate matter present in the air results from industrial activities, fuel combustion and wildfires, open burning of waste is a substantial contributor in many countries. 
For example, [in China open waste burning is equivalent to 22% of total anthropogenic PM<sub>10</sub> emissions][4].


[Our oceans contains 96.5% of all water on our planet][6]. 
It is both a major source of food and a major carbon sink. 
Our oceans seem vast, especially when you are trying to cross one, but they contain only 1,337.5 billion tonnes of water (see the [visualisation][8] below). 
Compare that to the [0.012 billion tonnes of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans every year][7].
[In 1992 a container of yellow rubber ducks fell into the Pacific Ocean][5], and since then [these ducks wash up on the shores all around the globe][8]. 
This accident revealed that all our oceans are connected via a worldwide network of currents. 
A [study by Erik van Sebille][9], with a setup that is very similar to the rubber duck scenario, showed that the waste that starts its journey from the populated costal areas is moved by the currents into the open ocean within months. 
This is how the six major garbage patches formed in the gyres of of our oceans. 
The study showed that there is no set destination - waste released from one specific place eventually ends up in all garbage patches; explore the model [here][10]. 
The North Pacific patch is the largest attractor, the study predicts that over multi-millennial timescales most of the global marine debris will end up there. 
While floating plastic waste gets the most attention, about 97% of plastic waste in our oceans is not floating and hence not visible from the surface. 
Many scientists agree that among all the contaminants (solid, liquid and gas) currently ending up in our oceans, the plastic is not the worst.

in animals - causing choking, starvation and eventual death. Land animals, including cattle and goats, too.





### Resulting greenhouse gas emissions

- methane from landfills (and spectacular explosions)
- CO2 from open burning
- missed opportunity to reduce emissions from production by recycling instead

[The open burning of waste, whether at individual residences, businesses, or dump sites, is a large source of air pollutants. These emissions, however, are not included in many current emission inventories used for chemistry and climate modeling applications. Global emissions of CO2 from open waste burning are relatively small compared to total anthropogenic CO2; however, regional CO2 emissions, particularly in many developing countries in Asia and Africa, are substantial. ][4]


### Impact on human health

This is something we all have in common - desire to be healthy.


Impact on people
- immediate health impacts. The immediate health impacts also include diarrhoea-related diseases caused by direct contact with solid waste or by the consumption of contaminated food, soil or water.
- long term health impacts. the floods and insanitary conditions resulting from the uncollected waste blocking drains lead to up to 4% of diarrhoea-related mortality, which translates into 67,000 - 141,000 deaths a year.
- impact on kids not yet born
- also economic impacts (tourism, fishing)
- mosquito breeding grounds. uncollected waste also creates favorable conditions for the proliferation of mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue and malaria,

Numbers show that 22% of premature mortality in developing countries related to air pollution come from the practice of burning waste where collection is not set up.

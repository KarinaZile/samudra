### Incineration is successfully used in many countries


<!-- in Africa -->
[Reppie waste-to-energy plant][1] in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, opened in 2018; it was the first one in Africa.
It processes about 1350 tonnes of waste a day, over 80% of the city's waste.
This results in hundreds of local jobs, cleaner air in the city and significantly less methane emissions from waste. 
The plant produces electricity to power 30% of the city's homes and bricks made from bottom ash.

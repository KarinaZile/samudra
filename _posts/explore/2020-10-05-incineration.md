<!-- what is it -->
Incineration is just a fancy word for controlled combustion or burning.
Combustion is a high-temperature exothermic chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant, in this case waste and atmospheric oxygen.
Heat and light energy is released during this reaction and transferred to the surroundings, hence it is called an exothermic reaction.


Incineration is a thermal treatment method suitable for different types of waste. 
Municipal solid waste (MSW) and other non-hazardous waste can be readily incinerated.
Medical waste is often required by law to be sterilised, for example in an autoclave, at the facility where it was produced before being transported to an incinerator.
Hazardous waste requires a special combustion chamber design that is able to withstand corrosive and abrasive substances, and allows specific residual products to be collected for reuse.


### How it works

<!-- the basics -->
The main parts of an incinerator are a furnace, a boiler with heat exchangers, a water supply system, a turbine and a generator. 
The combustion of the waste happens in the furnace below the boiler. 
The heated gases from the furnace rise into a series of chambers in the boiler. 
This heat vaporises the water in the boiler's heat exchangers, a series of pipes filled with water, and creates superheated high pressure steam.
This steam forces the blades of the turbine to rotate, driving the generator and making electricity. 
The water travels throught the system in a closed loop cycle - after passing through the turbine as steam it cools down and condenses back to liquid, then it returns to the heat exchangers to be heated again.

<!-- the waste goes in -->
As the waste arrives at an incinerator it is stored in bunkers.
It is important for optimum incineration that the waste is off uniform quality.
To achieve that, the waste is often mixed or shredded during pre-processing.
Depending on the moisture content of the waste, it is either desirable to keep it in a bunker for several days to allow the moisture to sip down or processing it as quickly as possible is prefered due to a high risk of accidental ignition.
Large grippers transfer the waste into the chutes leading to moving grates in the furnace. 
Feeding uniform quality waste at the right speed avoids hot spots within the furnace and allows for a uniform temperature to be maintained. 

<!-- combustion -->
The combustion occurs at a temperature between 800&#8451; and 1200&#8451;. 
Maintaining the required high temperature is essential to ensure that complete combustion and to form stable end products.
If due to high moisture content the waste cannot self-sustain the required temperature during combustion, additional fuel has to be added,  for example propane or waste with high calorific value.

<!-- bottom ash -->
The principal byproducts of combustion are bottom ash and flue gas.
The bottom ash is non hazardous; it contains mostly incombustible waste, for example metals, glass and pebbles.
Iron and non-ferrous metals, for example aluminium and copper, are recovered from the bottom ash using magnetic separation, air table sorting or sieving.
High value metals like gold and silver are usually present in particles of less than 2mm in diameter. 
Once the metals have been extracted, the rest of the bottom ash is either sent to a landfill or cleaned and subsequently used by the construction industry.
The bottom ash can be used as sand substitution in asphalt and cement. Â 
[Research][2] conducted in Thailand showed that addition of bottom ash to Portland cement results in similar compressive strengths and decreased water requirement.
Similarly, [addition of bottom ash to calcium sulfo-aluminate cement][3], which is used in high early strength and rapid setting applications, results in similar compressive strengths and porosity.
Technologie that would allow to extract and reuse valuable materials from the bottom ash are an active area of research.

### Incineration is successfully used in many countries


<!-- in Africa -->
[Reppie waste-to-energy plant][1] in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, opened in 2018; it was the first one in Africa.
It processes about 1350 tonnes of waste a day, over 80% of the city's waste.
This results in hundreds of local jobs, cleaner air in the city and significantly less methane emissions from waste. 
The plant produces electricity to power 30% of the city's homes and bricks made from bottom ash.

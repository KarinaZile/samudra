During the production of both conventional plastics and bioplastics, a variety of ‘additives’ may be added to the polymer to change its character. Common additives include plasticisers (used to enhance flexibility and durability), ultraviolet blockers, thermal stabilisers, dyes and pigments, and flame retardants. Some of these additives are toxic at low doses, and can leak out of the plastic affecting the environment and human health. Additives from the original plastics may increase the toxicity of recovered plastics.


Biogeradable plastics will degrade to water, CO2 and methane in favourable conditions. They cannot be recycled.

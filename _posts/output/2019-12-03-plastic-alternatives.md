A lot of effort is put into designing alternatives to plastic.


A lot of attention is on alternatives to plastics. A lot of them are bad. A paper bag (that you are less likely to reuse than a plastic one, and that is pretty useless in rainy/humid climate) costs orders of magnitude more CO2 than a plastic bag. Bio-degradable plastics is bad because it's not-recycleable - hence nobody collects it to sell it to a recycling facility, but if left in the environment it bio-degrades in about 300 years, which is not ideal. There is even such evil as oxo-plastics - plastics that degrades super quickly...into microplastics. So it looks good (it disappears) but it is the quickest way to ocean ecosystem collapse.

About 9% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled.



China banned imports of most waste types in 2018, and Thailand plans to stop importing plastic waste from 2021. That material is now being sent to countries that have weaker waste regulations, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and the Philippine.

the volumes required for recycling, and the cost of collecting and sorting are barriers that can make some plastics uneconomical to recycle

Plastics that do get recycled are typically made into lower value items in a process known as ‘down-cycling’.
Recycled plastics used for food packaging require a thin layer  of virgin plastic coating to achieve food contact grade standards.

Recycling plastics into drink/food containers is expensive and unnecessary. I don't think we should make drinks bottles from recycled plastics. Colourants, conditioners (to make it more flexible) and flame retardants that are used in plastics production makes recycled plastic unsafe for contact with human food/drink. For that reason it's necessary to coat the recycled plastic with virgin plastic on the inside where it will touch drink/food. Totally unrelated, we are running out of sand for construction (https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/04/24/why-there-is-a-shortage-of-sand), and the construction industry is a major contributor of CO2. Companies like this one (https://www.wascompany.com/polycrete-by-was-co) are recycling plastics into building materials, which is a much better idea than trying to make recycled plastics safe for contact with human food/drink. And in populated places like India, construction materials are much needed. 



Recycling plastics produces a lot of CO2 - transportation to the recycling place (often another country), recycling process itself. If it costs us less CO2 to produce virgin plastics, so be it. Plastics in a landfill doesn't hurt anyone. Right now we need to do anything we can to reduce emissions. Landfilling everything is not a smart solution, but I'm aiming to cut CO2 emisions, not to look smart.

* Burning waste for energy (for example, Tokyo)
* Selling shredded waste as burnable fuel (for example, Broquers ambiental in Quer√©taro)
* Converting plastic waste into liquid fuel



Some countries, including France and Germany, recover energy from this process to use for heating or the generation of power.
Incinerating plastics releases toxic fumes, including dioxins and other persistent organic pollutants known to cause cancer and birth defects. Under optimum conditions, technologies can reduce the amount of toxins in these emissions to very low levels (<0.1 to 10 ng/m3).49 Ash generated from incineration can also be hazardous to human health and the environment.


Through recycling plastic looses quality. Hence plastics of lowest quality (it costs least resources and CO2 to produce it) is not recyclable. Instead of trying to make plastics out of plastics, why don't we convert plastic waste into fuel that can be sold in a gas station? Yes, it is polluting and fumes can be toxic. Still much better than the fuel that's used in poor parts of India today. I've been there, I've seen it. I've also seen a youtube video of an Indian guy who makes a living by collecting plastics, converting it into fuel and selling it in 2 litter bottles.
